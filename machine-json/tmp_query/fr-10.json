  "Something flashes inside Lilith's eye. Recognition, you can only hope... her approach hastens ever so slightly.": "",
  "Do you remember what Kyr said?": "",
  "You mention Kyr, and Lilith hastens further. She'll be atop you in a moment.": "",
  "He said you could trust me, Lilith, and I know I can trust you too. Stand your ground.": "",
  "Mere inches away from you, Lilith stops. At lightning speed, a writhing tendril tears itself from her body and... grabs the photo. It seems to be capable of keeping her calm, slowly, and politely, you take the photo back, to which Lilith makes no move to stop you. As you leave the room and make for your ship, she follows, and you realize you've pacified an eldritch abomination... still, she's your friend, too. Once you're back on the ship, you take out the book, and Lilith reacts to its presence with a low growl.": "",
  "Lilith": "",
  "Inspect the book.": "",
  "Flipping through its pages, you realize you can't read any of it. It's written in a script that none of your translators or crew recognize... save for Lilith, who stares at the crimson text with intensity. With a mysterious ink expelled from her body, she writes out a cipher on the floor at your request... you wonder just how much of her is still in there, if she's capable of such a thing. Eventually, with the cipher finished, you're able to recognize that the text does indeed depict several rituals... most notably, a ritual that allows one to ascend and convene with the Dark One. You glance at Lilith.": "",
  "Did you...": "",
  "She growls, and you gulp. Delving further into the book's pages, there's other colors of text, ones that Lilith's cipher doesn't cover. She must not be able to read all of them... maybe you can find someone who can. In the meantime, there appear to be a few rituals that increase the extent of one's power, given that they've already performed the ascension ritual. If you perform these rituals, you might be able to make Lilith stronger... who knows what price you might have to pay, though.": "",
  "Kyr...": "",
  "There's nothing you could have done. You'll have to move forward, and do what you can to take care of Lilith... as well as complete these otherworldly rituals, if you so desire.": "",
  "You realize, rather quickly, that this book is identical to the Otherworldly Tome already within your possession. She and Kyr must've performed some unspeakable ritual contained within its pages, with him serving as its sacrifice... horrible, to say the least, but there's little of value to you in owning a second copy of the ghastly book. You leave it behind, and Lilith's ceaseless writhing seems to calm down ever so slightly.": "",
  "Now! Sprint past the abomination and get out of here!": "",
  "As Lilith charges, you dodge past her, dropping both the book and the photograph. You don't know what has become of her, and you sure as hell don't trust such a nightmare with your life. As you make for the ship, you hear Lilith... sob, behind you. It's a disturbing, twisted sobbing. You can't let it phase you, though... you still need to get out of this hellish realm.": "",
  "Leave it, and get out of here.": "",
  "You're not sure you want to know the truth of what happened here, or of what lies just beyond that door. Content on getting out of here, you prepare to continue your battle against the Dark God and its shadows.": "",
  "You're expecting to see Kyr and Lilith's ship, but instead you're met with... wait, no, this IS Kyr and Lilith's ship. At least, it's in the shape of it, but it's all twisted and enveloped in darkness... what's happened? You don't get a lot of time to think on it, as the nightmarish form of your friends' ship moves in to attack!": "",
  "You arrive at the exit of this dreadful journey once more... this time, will you take it?": "",
  "Now that you're at the exit, the darkness seems... still. All feels calm.": "",
  "Though, this tranquility doesn't last long... you feel as the space around you warps, and time itself seems to slow again. Then, to your unease, the Dark God tears its way back into your mind, \"TO COME THIS FAR IS MOST IMPRESSIVE. YOU STAND AT THE PRECIPICE; ESCAPE IS IN REACH.

Apparently, everyone had similar experiences; an overwhelming sense of dread followed by waiting in the darkness and refusing to speak to whatever was there. One particularly flustered crew member, however, reports that the being in the darkness actually spoke to them... nonstop, in fact. They claim it kept repeating a string of numbers, over, and over, and over, and over... until the power returned and nothing was there.

  "\"You hate riddles... THAT much?\" You move in to attack the riddling Deep One merchant, and it prepares to defend itself.": "",
  "\"Maybe... next time, then.\" They close communications.": "",
  "Yeah, a welcome sight... a ship to blow up!": "",
  "The merchant ship notices your refusal to accept hails as you approach and turns hostile. Prepare for combat.": "",
  "You ignore the merchant ship, and the merchant ship ignores you.": "",
  "Upon arriving at the beacon, several Deep One ships whiz past your view. Then, several more... there's an entire armada here! You glance around, looking for the merchant ship, and finally spot it within a crowd of other ships. It'd be suicide to attack it with such a fleet at the ready.": "",
  "Approach the ship and hail.": "",
  "The merchant accepts your hail, but he appears to be busy packing something in the background.": "",
  "Inquire as to what he's doing.": "",
  "\"Preparing to... head off for war. We all are, were it not... obvious. The... Theocracy has been ruthless, and we... don't intend to stand idly by.\"": "",
  "(Lost Sun) Your commando wishes to speak.": "",
  "With a remorseful look in their eyes, your member of the Lost Suns steps forward to speak to the merchant, \"Of smoldered rock or scaly flesh, it matters not to the Theocracy. We are both seen as a disease, with this 'holy' crusade being their attempt at a cure. We are bound by this, the Elders' ire, and as such I see you as no lesser than any Lost Sun; to me, we are kin, and we could use your strength in the battles to come.\"": "",
  "The merchant seems to have really taken your commando's speech to heart. You can see them tearing up a bit, but, for a moment, they don't reply. Eventually, they break the silence, \"Your words... speak true... kin. Yet, this is a fight that I cannot... abandon. My people here, they... need me. Should there be... anything I can do for you, though, let it be... known.\"": "",
  "Glance outside at his repair team and ask if you could have them go to work on your hull.": "",
  "He nods his head and sends his team to repair your hull. You're offered a chance to shop while they get to work.": "",
  "Glance at the Deep One lighting fixtures that lay uninstalled in the corner of the room.": "",
  "He catches your glance and responds, \"An... impressive feat of technology, our luminescence... Should you install them... I'm sure you'll find the results to be... satisfactory.\" You take him up on his offer and take a moment to shop while they're being installed.": "",
  "Glance at the Deep One weapon sitting on a nearby shelf and ask if you can have it.": "",
  "He seems to ponder the request for a moment, and then accepts. \"The... Jellyfish Beam. Among the first... weapons created by our ancient kin. They studied... existing ion technology, and then concentrated it... ensuring it would never miss its intended target. Feel... free to shop as I have it installed.\"": "",
  "Offer to help fund the war effort.": "",
  "His face lights up at your generosity.": "",
  "\"You are... a kind soul. Should you be... willing, I'd like to employ one of my... finest to protect you during these... turbulent times in exchange for this... altruism. Of course, you're welcome to... shop as well.\"": "",
  "Offer a mighty sum to help fund the war effort.": "",
  "His eyes go wide at your generosity.": "",
  "\"Your kindness is... truly heartening. I'll see to it that we... slow down the rebels for you while on our... crusade. Please, buy... whatever you need.\" You're not sure how he knew you were on the run from the rebels but you appreciate the gesture nonetheless.": "",
  "Offer to practically pay for the whole damn war yourself.": "",
  "He jumps back in shock as a pile of scrap larger than himself is teleported into the room next to him.": "",
  "\"You either... really love us or... really hate the Theocracy. As such... I find no greater irony than entrusting you with... their general, whom we've captured. He's quite... obedient, after the hell we've... put him through. Feel free... to shop and then do with him... as you see fit.\"": "",
  "Request to shop.": "",
  "He doesn't turn around, but hurriedly mutters \"Yes, yes...\" and ushers you inside.": "",
  "Heh, \"Suicide\" is my middle name! Attack that merchant!": "",
  "Well, Federation \"Suicide\" Renegade, you're able to make it about eleven seconds before you're spotted and asked to make your intentions known. You respond with two middle fingers and are promptly shot at by over a dozen ships. Needless to say, you don't reach the merchant.": "",
  "You ignore the merchant ship and are not bothered as the FTL charges.": "",
  "In an act that can only be described as a miracle, your cloaking manages to last long enough for your crew to dock with the merchant ship, rob them blind, and then get out of there without anybody noticing a thing. Poor sap was busy packing while muttering some nonsense about going off to war.": "",
  "Your cloaking lasts long enough for your crew to dock with the merchant ship, but as they begin to start taking things as they see fit you realize your cloaking's about to give out. You hurry them back with their light haul, but, as you expected, your cloaking wears off during the getaway! The merchant realizes what's happened and requests immediate fire support. A few shots graze your hull as you escape, but, overall, it could've been much worse.": "",
  "Unfortunately, your cloaking gives out before you even reach the merchant ship. Startled by your sudden appearance, the nearby ships attack you, shredding your hull as you try to make your getaway.": "",
  "There's a Deep One merchant vessel here, who promptly hails you upon your entrance to the beacon and offers to trade.": "",
  "Look around and shop.": "",
  "The lights within the Deep One store are practically blinding, and you can't get over the overwhelming smell of must and fish. Just as you think this assault on your senses can't get any worse, the clerk just screams at the ceiling for no discernible reason. You try your best to shop quickly.": "",
  "You've decided to attack the trader.": "",
  "You're hailed the second you enter the beacon...": "",
  "Two Deep Ones show up on the monitor, but before you can say anything they just start screaming. Then, they... keep screaming.": "",
  "Stare in disbelief.": "",
  "After a few minutes of more screaming, the Deep Ones suddenly cut communications and promptly refuse further hails. Such civility...": "",
  "Scream back.": "",
  "You scream at the Deep Ones, who go silent and recoil in shock. One speaks, \"Such... barbarism.\" to which the other responds \"We knew Feds were... stupid, yet I still find myself utterly... astonished.\" You shrug, and they cut communications. You go to leave when, suddenly, their weapons come to life! Talk about barbarism...": "",
  "(Deep One) Have your Deep One scream back.": "",
  "Your Deep One screams and the two opposing Deep Ones are taken aback. \"Such... eloquence.\" claims one, \"Such... beauty!\" proclaims the other. They seem starstruck, and offer to trade. Nothing around here makes any sense to you...": "",
  "Refuse the hail.": "",
  "Whatever this ship wants, you aren't interested. You decline their request to hail, and their weapons spring to life in response!": "",
  "The colony thanks you a thousand times over for your heroism and offers to trade.": "",
  "There's a Deep One trading colony on a nearby moon here, a member of which promptly hails you upon your entrance to the beacon and offers to trade.": "",
  "Move in to trade.": "",
  "You're almost there when you detect an FTL signature nearby, it appears that a Rock ship has jumped into the beacon! They move in to attack the colony, whose anti-ship batteries can't penetrate the Rocks' hull armor.": "",
  "Protect the colony!": "",
  "Not today, you crazed zealots. You prepare to intercept the now hostile Rock ship.": "",
  "Betray the colony and offer the Rocks some ammunition to make their job a little easier.": "",
  "The Rocks take the ammunition and chuckle.": "",
  "You decide to not intervene. You're sure you've just left the colony to a terrible fate, but it's not any of your business.": "",
  "(Crystal) Have your Crystal hail the Rocks.": "",
  "Upon viewing your Crystal, the Rocks go into hysterics; screaming and smashing everything around them. In the process, one of them must have accidentally hit the button that triggers the FTL, as the ship promptly jumps out of the beacon. The colony is about as dumbfounded as you are, but they thank you and offer to trade nonetheless.": "",
  "You're not interested in trading right now.": "",
  "You see them bundle the missiles together with whatever material they had laying around and promptly launch the makeshift bomb at the colony. It's completely leveled by the explosion, and debris is sent flying everywhere. You scrap some, and the Rock ship leaves; satisfied with their work.": "",
  "However, moments later an explosion rocks their ship! They must've accidentally set a missile off but, suspecting that you sent them faulty ammunition, the Rocks turn on you. Meanwhile, the colony's inhabitants collectively figure this must've been a planned reverse-betrayal and are rooting for you.": "",
  "Before you shop, you still have some time to do something else aboard the ship.": "",
  "There's a colony of Deep Ones at this beacon, and upon your approach they beckon you to land.": "",
  "We have some time to spare, agree to land.": "",
  "You approach the Deep One colony with caution, but your wariness is quickly proven to be unwarranted. They explain that they so rarely see visitors and are ecstatic at your arrival, soon showering you with gifts! You return the favor with lavish stories of your exploits across the Multiverse, the Deep Ones' eyes further widening in wonder with each self-indulgent tale. Though you spend more time than you probably should, your crew appreciates the rare moment of respite.": "",
  "We don't have any time to spare.": "",
  "You explain to the Deep Ones that time is of the upmost importance in regards to your mission. They're saddened by your refusal, but they understand.": "",
  "You begin to make a mental note to have a word with the Federation engineers responsible for your ship's systems, but you're met with a strange sight once you get back to your room. An assorted pile of junk sits in the middle of it, a mess of scrap and resources that's somehow been planted here whilst leaving the rest of the room undisturbed. Your crew's as clueless about it as you are once you ask around, and the cameras seem to have been conveniently disabled during the incident. Though it makes you uneasy, you surmise that free scrap is free scrap and prepare to leave the beacon in a hurry.": "",
  "You begin to make a mental note to have a word with the Federation engineers responsible for your ship's systems, but you're met with a strange sight once you get back to your room. A neatly stacked pile of reactor cores sits in the middle of it, a sizeable collection that's somehow been planted here whilst leaving the rest of the room undisturbed. Your crew's as clueless about it as you are once you ask around, and the cameras seem to have been conveniently disabled during the incident. Though it makes you uneasy, you surmise that free cores are free cores and prepare to leave the beacon in a hurry.": "",
  "You begin to make a mental note to have a word with the Federation engineers responsible for your ship's systems, but you're met with a strange sight once you get back to your room. A peculiar piece of machinery sits in the middle of it, a weapon of ominous make that's somehow been planted here whilst leaving the rest of the room undisturbed. Your crew's as clueless about it as you are once you ask around, and the cameras seem to have been conveniently disabled during the incident. Though it makes you uneasy, you surmise that a free weapon is a free weapon and prepare to leave the beacon in a hurry.": "",
  "You begin to make a mental note to have a word with the Federation engineers responsible for your ship's systems, but you're met with a strange sight once you get back to your room. A peculiar piece of machinery sits in the middle of it, a drone of ominous make that's somehow been planted here whilst leaving the rest of the room undisturbed. Your crew's as clueless about it as you are once you ask around, and the cameras seem to have been conveniently disabled during the incident. Though it makes you uneasy, you surmise that a free drone is a free drone and prepare to leave the beacon in a hurry.": "",
  "Immediately upon entering the system, your ship identifies a foreign mass materializing in the ship's hold. There's no ships nearby for anyone to have teleported from, so you suspect it's a false alarm, but nevertheless you approach the hold with a blaster in hand. Upon further inspection, your suspicions are quickly proven to be correct, as there's nothing out of order here.": "",
  "Your team makes a break for the exit, but they manage to stumble upon something they weren't expecting along the way: an Engi Separatist, simply standing there in the hallway. It wasn't here earlier... your crew ask it to identify itself, but it ignores them and instead addresses you directly, \"I have been: -waiting- for you, Renegade. Our time here: is [short].\" It turns to your crew, finally acknowledging them, \"Quickly: -this- way.\" It leads your crew through the maze of hallways, confident in its movements, and, indeed, they manage to make it out much quicker than you expected. Once onboard, the Engi doesn't request to join your crew as much as it simply... does. You don't have any qualms with that, you suppose.": "",
  "You don't say a word, but your team agrees with you. They quickly turn around and begin to sprint back the way they came but, to their bewilderment, they find the exit within the first couple minutes of backtracking. Though this endeavour has proven fruitless, at least your crew's okay.": "",
  "You decide it's time to pull out, but... where exactly is out? Your team spends what feels like hours trying to retrace their steps, until eventually they come across the initial T-shaped hallway they entered from. They barely make it out before the ship buckles for the last time, collapsing in on itself. The fleet's surely caught up to you in the meantime, and you've gotten absolutely nothing out of it, but at least your crew's safe.": "",
  "Your team doesn't struggle to find their way out, but they notice something odd as they approach the exit... the sound of footsteps, echoing towards them. Rapidly. They make a sprint for it as SOMETHING follows them at an impossible speed, and, though they barely manage to make it back onboard in time, you're not able to close the airlock before whatever was following them makes its way inside as well... just what in the hell IS this thing?": "",
  "You're met with the sight of a Deep One wreck, its signatures completely cold but its lights as radiant as ever. There's no telling how long it's been here, and the hull seems to somehow be impenetrable to your ship's scans.": "",
  "Inspect the inside of the ship.": "",
  "You send a team to explore the inside of the ship, though upon entering you can immediately tell that this place won't hold together much longer. With that time limit in mind, your team embarks - requesting your instructions in exploring the labyrinth.": "",
  "Go... right.": "",
  "Your team copies and heads right. After a few minutes of silently wandering through the iridescent halls, your team reports a collective sense of dread amongst themselves. You don't think much of it at first, but then you begin to recognize a pattern in the turns your crew are making. It appears that these hallways loop endlessly, but... they haven't seen the entrance since, well, entering. Your crew begins to panic, and you hear the ship buckle. There's not much time left before it rips itself apart.": "",
  "Assure them to keep going.": "",
  "You reassure your team that everything is fine and encourage them to push forward. Begrudgingly, they begin to comply, but moments later they've stopped again. You've nearly returned to reassuring them when you notice the tall, motionless shadow of a figure just out of view ahead of them. Is this the first hallway without a light?": "",
  "Demand that they confront the figure.": "",
  "With stern resolve, you demand that your crew confronts the figure ahead of them. Before they can even protest, however, the visuals on the call abruptly go down and not even a split second later all you can hear through the comms is screaming... followed by heavy footsteps. Both quickly grow fainter and it becomes apparent that your team has dropped their mics amidst the panic. All you can do is sit there in disbelief and wait.": "",
  "A few minutes go by and, miraculously, your team emerges from the wreck; still screaming and with a Deep One chasing in tow! You demand an explanation and though your crew is in hysterics, the Deep One begs to be given a chance to speak. As it turns out, he didn't mean to scare your team and was merely likewise shocked at the sight of outsiders on what remained of his ship. He explains that he's been drifting for a few days as a result of a collision tearing the engines apart, stranding him here and slowly depressurizing the ship. As if on cue, the ship buckles for the last time and collapses in on itself in the background. Disgruntled, and with nothing left for him here, he offers to join your crew to try to make amends for all the accidental fright he's caused.": "",
  "Alright, it's definitely time to leave.": "",
  "Maybe it's time to leave.": "",
  "Go... left.": "",
  "Your team copies and heads left. After a few minutes of silently wandering through the iridescent halls, they come across a couple rooms labeled in an alien tongue that your translators can't recognize. You hear the ship begin to buckle, and it quickly becomes apparent that you don't have time to explore both rooms.": "",
  "Enter the dark room.": "",
  "Your crew heads into the room without any lighting, and quickly figure out that it's the ship's resource hold. They gather what loot they can and prepare to leave before the inside of the ship comes crashing down around them. Mission successful.": "",
  "Enter the illuminated room.": "",
  "Your crew enters the blindingly bright room, but are unsure of what to make of their surroundings. The room appears to twist in one's peripheral vision, each corner never remaining constant unless focused upon. One thing that's certain is that the room is empty, save for the dismantled remains of an Engi. Though, upon further inspection, it's not a form you've ever seen any Engi take... Black and purple, with no arms, and strange spikes jutting out its back; its nanites ever shifting, akin to the room around it.": "",
  "(Disparity Crew) Wait a minute. You know exactly what this is!": "",
  "These are the remains of a Disparity Elite! You have your team grab them and pull out, and, once aboard, your own Disparity crew member gets to work on putting them together again. Once finished, the newly rebuilt Disparity Elite stutters a few words in thanks, \"[B-b-b-brothers...] -here...?- T-t-thank: y-you...\" They'll take some time to fully recover, but, as thanks, they offer to join your crew!": "",
  "(Separatist Crew) Your Separatist seems to recognize the design.": "",
  "They speak to you through the comms, \"I have: heard -tell- of these ones. I think: I can [fix] them.\" You have your team grab the dismantled Engi and pull out, and, once aboard, your Separatist crew member gets to work on putting them together again. Once finished, the newly rebuilt Engi stutters a few more words in thanks, \"[B-b-b-brothers...] -here...?- T-t-thank: y-you...\" They'll take some time to fully recover, but, as thanks, the strange Engi offers to join your crew!": "",
  "I don't know what this is.": "",
  "As strange as it is, there's nothing you can do. You hear as the ship buckles... this will have to be a mystery for another day.": "",
  "It's time to leave.": "",
  "(Deep One) Your Deep One offers to read the labels for you.": "",
  "Your Deep One explains that the dark room is labelled 'HOLD' and that the illuminated one is, quite literally, labelled 'DANGER METAL MAN'.": "",
  "Enter the hold.": "",
  "Your crew heads into the hold. They gather what loot they can and prepare to leave before the inside of the ship comes crashing down around them. Mission successful.": "",
  "Enter the strangely labeled room.": "",
  "Scrap the outside of the ship.": "",
  "You skirt around the outside of the ship and scrap what you can.": "",
  "You don't have any time for ominous wrecks, let alone ones in Deep One space. Not trying to get jumped by some kind of abominable horror, you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "\"Quick... to answer. So be it, then. An enemy of the Theocracy... is a friend of ours.\" they say, before offering to share in some spoils from their recent heist of a Rock outpost! They regale you with tales of their exploits as their ship zooms into view, and, while they transfer the spoils over, you regale them with tales of your own.": "",
  "\"So... you say. I... am not so easily fooled.\" They cut communications, having never revealed their ship, and you're left wondering how exactly they expected you to answer that.": "",
  "Before you can do anything, you're hailed with an invitation to a call on a private channel. You don't see any ships nearby when you look outside. Feels odd...": "",
  "Accept the call.": "",
  "You're greeted with a dark room, duly lit by cyan lights on the ceiling. While you can't make anything out, you recognize the lights as being the same ones the Deep Ones use. A voice from the darkness speaks, \"Have you... respect for the Rocks?\" and silence ensues as they wait for a reply.": "",
  "\"Then we have no business with you.\" The call is ended, and you're left alone in silence.": "",
  "(Deep One) Let your Deep One answer.": "",
  "Your Deep One growls something scathing over the mic. The Deep Ones over the call seem to quite enjoy this answer, and after laughing for a moment brighten the room to reveal themselves. \"An enemy of the Theocracy... is a friend of ours.\" they say, before offering to share in some spoils from their recent heist of a Rock outpost! They regale you with tales of their exploits as their ship zooms into view, and, while they transfer the spoils over, you regale them with tales of your own.": "",
  "(Rock Crew) Let your Rockman answer.": "",
  "Your Rockman answers \"Yes! An infinite well of respect!\" proudly, and you're met with a brief moment of silence before the other end replies; \"A shame. An infinite well... of shame.\" The call is ended, and you're left alone in silence.": "",
  "(Crystal) Let your Crystal answer.": "",
  "Your Crystal shuffles a bit and answers meekly, \"Not particularly. Those guys are a little weird, and... fanatical.\" and you hear a sigh from the Deep Ones as they reply; \"Fanatical... to an extreme. Still, an enemy of the Theocracy... is a friend of ours.\" they say, before offering to share in some spoils from their recent heist of a Rock outpost! They regale you with tales of their exploits as their ship zooms into view, and, while they transfer the spoils over, you regale them with tales of your own.": "",
  "Of course not.": "",
  "Refuse the call.": "",
  "No attempt to call again is made. You have some time before the FTL charges... though you feel uneasy.": "",
  "Something feels off as you pull into the beacon. You're met with the sight of a Deep One outpost, but your hails aren't answered and the whole place seems still.": "",
  "Dock into the station.": "",
  "You and your crew enter the station, and things quickly get weird. There are innumerable Deep Ones, all unmoving, their stares trance-like. You know Deep Ones are an odd bunch, but this seems bizarre even for them. Are they okay?": "",
  "Try to grab a Deep One's attention.": "",
  "You walk up to one of the Deep Ones and wave. Nothing. You clap a few times and still, nothing.": "",
  "Try shaking it.": "",
  "You clasp your hands around the Deep One's shoulders, and immediate dread fills your very being upon making contact. You see dozens of images, each filling you with more terror than the last; visions of rituals and cults. A Deep One brutalized, scarred; blood splatters across the ground as an entourage of yellow Deep Ones look on in worship of the horrible display. Prayers and followers in the name of...": "",
  "You're brought back to reality as your crew pulls you away. What the hell was that, and why did you see it? What's going on with these Deep Ones?": "",
  "Head deeper into the outpost.": "",
  "You and your crew walk past countless Deep Ones, and never once do they stir. At the heart of the outpost lies a pile of... garbage? No, scrap, and a note with it that reads \"For you... captain.\" Do the Deep Ones really put pauses in their writing, too? No, more importantly, is this for you? Did they know you were coming? Your questions fall on deaf ears as the Deep Ones continue to stare into nothing for what feels like eternity, not moving an inch as you and your crew retreat to your ship with your newfound scrap.": "",
  "This isn't right, head back before something goes wrong.": "",
  "You and your crew turn back around, and the Deep Ones still don't move. Disturbed, but safe, you've got some time to kill before the FTL charges.": "",
  "Stop trying, and just keep walking.": "",
  "Ignore the Deep Ones and keep moving.": "",
  "(Deep One) Your Deep One looks troubled.": "",
  "You look to your Deep One for insight into the situation, but they don't seem too keen to provide answers. After pushing a little, they say one word; \"Ritual.\" They insist you leave the Deep Ones here undisturbed. Ominous...": "",
  "Push deeper into the outpost.": "",
  "Turn back, this doesn't feel right.": "",
  "This is way too weird. Get out.": "",
  "Nope. Staying right here.": "",
  "You don't trust this outpost. As such, you fire up the FTL and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "What??? How'd you do that???": "",
  "You try your best to fly in the general direction of where the ship was, and you breathe a sigh of relief as its silhouette appears in the near distance. Once there, you're able to make its shape out enough to dock, but you're also able to recognize that the damage to its hull is truly severe. If anyone alive's left onboard, odds are that you don't have much time to save them.": "",
  "Hurry!": "",
  "Despite your best efforts, your search proves to be fruitless. Eventually, deciding that feeling around in the dark is pointless, you make the call to prepare to leave before the Rebellion gains any more ground.": "",
  "It doesn't take long for you to find the shrouded ship... as you crash into it, sending it cascading back into the darkness! Maybe cluelessly searching around in the dark wasn't the greatest idea after all, but, at least the damage isn't too severe. Still, you're not going to risk trying to find it again...": "",
  "You rush onboard the damaged ship, but quickly realize it's just as dark in here as it was out there... and, yet, you don't necessarily feel as lost. An esoteric warmth in your chest seems to guide you forward, and you don't so much as bump into anything as you traverse the pitch black halls. Eventually, your hand comes to rest on something. The feeling of its surface is alien, almost indescribable, but it emits a heat comparable to the one you feel guiding you. Something wanted you to find this... whatever it is.": "",
  "How strange...": "",
  "There's a loud, tearing noise, and the realization dawns on you that the ship is about to collapse. You're going to have to settle with taking... whatever this object is back, and you're going to have be quick! You pick it up, as heavy as it is, and make a sprint for the exit...": "",
  "Your mad, blind dash through the darkness goes as smoothly as your entrance had, to your amazement, and you're able to make a decisive leap back into your ship's airlock. As it closes, you see the ship behind you as it's torn apart, and for the first time you get a good look at the object you just risked your life to secure... it seems to be a strange weapon of sorts. The warmth in your chest leaves you, and the weapon quickly becomes almost searing hot to the touch. You're not sure what exactly it is, what's just happened here, or why you couldn't find any of the ship's inhabitants... but you're all the richer for it as you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "The two ships here, while undoubtedly of Deep One design, are not ones you can say you recognize in the slightest. Whereas most Deep One ships overcompensate with their lighting, these ones seem to lack any amount of external lights whatsoever. In fact, you feel as if they suck in the very light around them... you're not sure if they've noticed you, but you get the impression that they're communicating with each other.": "",
  "Approach the two ships.": "",
  "Before you can really get moving, an explosion rocks one of the mysterious Deep One ships; simultaneously, the other jumps out of the beacon. From where the first ship's hull was breached, a dark cloud begins to spew forth, and you find your ship rapidly enveloped in pitch blackness... it's impossible to see anything in here. Still, there's a chance you can locate the remaining ship before it's too late...": "",

  "The second Rock ship is at this beacon, as expected. \"You... chased me here? You want these lights that badly? Vicious, this so-called 'Federation.' Fine then, to battle!\" They cut communications. Prepare to fight.": "",
  "Indeed, there's little here of value... still, free scrap is free scrap.": "",
  "Though it's not an absurd amount of loot, you manage to find way more resources than you expected!": "",
  "You're moving from ship to ship, scrapping what you can when a strange, iridescent ship catches your eye... investigating its cargo, you manage to find a peculiar weapon in seemingly perfect condition. You weren't expecting to find something so unique in the equivalent of a space-landfill, but you've managed to all the same!": "",
  "Jackpot!": "",
  "Taking your new loot aboard, you notice as some sort of goo secretes off of it. This goo smacks against the floor, and then immediately begins to writhe and bubble before rising to take the form of a humanoid figure... this is a Soulplague Husk! More of these goo-things begin to propagate, and you realize you've got trouble!": "",
  "You're moving from ship to ship, scrapping what you can when a strange, decrepit Deep One ship catches your eye... investigating its cargo, you manage to find a peculiar weapon in seemingly perfect condition. You weren't expecting to find something so unique in the equivalent of a space-landfill, but you've managed to all the same!": "",
  "Taking your new loot aboard, you notice as some sort of darkness emanates from it. This darkness coalesces, eventually forming a mass of tentacles atop the floor. Then, another, and another... what is this madness? More of these shadow-things begin to propagate, and you realize you've got trouble!": "",
  "You're moving from ship to ship, scrapping what you can when a strange, crystalline ship catches your eye... investigating its cargo, you manage to find a peculiar drone in seemingly perfect condition. You weren't expecting to find something so unique in the equivalent of a space-landfill, but you've managed to all the same!": "",
  "A grim sight lays before you. The remains of dozens of ships, some Deep Ones, some Theocracy, are scattered across space here. One intact ship remains, a Deep One Scout that seems to be moving from wreck to wreck.": "",
  "A few seconds go by before they accept your request to open communications. \"Federation... Speak.\"": "",
  "What happened here?": "",
  "\"The answer remains... unclear. No... call for help was made. No... plans to attack the Theocracy were shared. What occurred... remains a mystery.\" The Deep One pauses. \"I'm here... analyzing. Searching for... anything.\"": "",
  "Any theories?": "",
  "The Deep One takes a moment to answer. \"I.. believe no fight was had. Rather...\" It looks around, as if to check if anybody's looking, \"...they were brought here. The... wrecks. Individually.\" It emphasizes that last word, rather ominously.": "",
  "Brought here? For what purpose?": "",
  "\"...Tribute.\" It doesn't elaborate.": "",
  "Tribute? From who, to what?": "",
  "It seems hesitant to answer for a while. Eventually, in a hushed tone, it says \"I... should not say. It is not... for you to know. Or... for me, to say.\"": "",
  "Insist.": "",
  "It looks like it's about to answer when, out of nowhere, communications are cut. You begin to move to hail them again when a violent flash from outside stops you in your tracks; the Deep One's ship has just exploded! It sends the nearby ship debris flying in all directions, and your ship with it. Whatever remains is beyond salvaging, and you're left with nothing but questions.": "",
  "The Deep One seems relieved to not be questioned further. \"I do believe... we are done here. Feel free to... make use of anything that remains. I... must go, and report.\" With that, the Deep One leaves, and you're left with the field of debris.": "",
  "Let's see what we can find here...": "",
  "Mind if I scrap all this?": "",
  "Slightly confused, it blinks, and then answers \"I... suppose I am done here. There's... little of value, but feel free to... use what you can.\" With that, the Deep One leaves, and you're left with the field of debris.": "",
  "You don't know what happened to these ships and you don't have any intention of joining them. The Deep One Scout turns to you, realizes your intent, and prepares to fight back.": "",
  "Ignore the ship, and the field.": "",
  "Uninterested, you turn away from the field and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "There's a Lanius ship at this beacon, but it doesn't appear to be doing much. Cautiously, you observe it for a while, but still; nothing.": "",
  "Lanius are notoriously difficult to communicate with, but you try anyways. They do, at the very least, accept your hail and say \"Stuck. Need eat. Lights, can't. Help?\" They appear to be trying to eat Deep One lights and failing...": "",
  "Offer them some scrap to eat.": "",
  "The Lanius gladly accept, but they quickly eat through it and turn back to you. \"Need eat more. Help?\" They're really hungry, you suppose...": "",
  "Offer them even more scrap to eat.": "",
  "This time, it takes them a bit longer to eat through it. Satisfied, they say \"Junk eat good. Lights don't eat good. Lights yours, thanks junk. Will send in minute. Any else?\"": "",
  "Yes, else. I kinda like feeding you guys.": "",
  "\"You, more junk?\" They look delighted, and take a minute to eat it.": "",
  "Once they're finished, one of the Lanius speaks up; \"Like you. Like you more junk. Staying you, many junk wait me.\" Moments later, the Deep One lights are beamed into your ship's hold, along with the Lanius! Seems he's up for an adventure, and he's in luck, because there's plenty of scrap to be found when you're working for a Renegade.": "",
  "No, else. Thank you.": "",
  "\"Understand. Thanks junk again.\" Moments later, the Deep One lights are beamed into your ship's hold. Somehow, they're in pristine condition despite the Lanius' innumerable attempts at eating them.": "",
  "I'm cutting you guys off.": "",
  "\"Have help, won't give. Need eat. Take help.\" Hungry enough to turn on you, the Lanius prepare to attack!": "",
  "I can't help, sorry.": "",
  "The Lanius look displeased, \"Understand. Try eat lights more.\" They return to what they were doing and promptly cut communications. Hopefully they manage to eat those lights...": "",
  "Whatever they're doing can't be good, attack!": "",
  "You give the order to charge the weapons and the Lanius recognize your aggression, they turn and prepare to defend themselves!": "",
  "You leave the Lanius to their... whatever it is that Lanius do, and prepare to leave the system.": "",
  "Upon arriving at the beacon, you are immediately hailed by a particularly furious Deep One. Though their translator is lacking, you're certainly able to pick up that you aren't wanted here.": "",
  "(Deep One) Your Deep One offers to step in.": "",
  "Over the course of a brief conversation between the two Deep Ones you watch as fury is quickly replaced with remorse. As it turns out, pirate raids have been ravaging the local Deep Ones in the area and they've since been wary of strangers. Teary-eyed, he turns to you, and your Deep One explains that he's curious as to your reasoning for coming here.": "",
  "We're on a quest to save this reality.": "",
  "He doesn't understand what you mean exactly, but he nods and seems eager to help get you on your way.": "",
  "We're passing through whilst trying to escape the rebel fleet.": "",
  "The fury returns to his eyes at the mention of the word \"rebel.\" He mutters something and, with an air of determination, turns away before cutting communications. Your Deep One assures you the fleet won't be getting through without a fight.": "",
  "We're kicking ass and taking scrap.": "",
  "Your Deep One stifles a laugh as you're both met with a blank stare. He begins to try to explain your words when he's cut off by what you can only describe as the garbled fish-man equivalent of screaming bloody murder... Suddenly, comms are cut, and you pick up a teleportation signature! Before anyone else reacts, your equally as confused Deep One intervenes and manages to parse that you've inspired the opposing captain to join you in your revelry... Somehow!": "",
  "Try to apologize and leave.": "",
  "Attack first!": "",
  "Who cares what the hell they're saying, if it's a fight they want it's a fight they'll get!": "",
  "You awkwardly manage to make it clear that you mean no harm and the opposing Deep One begrudgingly lets you go, yet you have a feeling that you're still being watched as you cut communications and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Despite your best efforts, it seems the Deep One on the other end has lost his patience. If you won't leave, he'll remove you by force!": "",
  "You're in the middle of processing the horrors you just witnessed when one final bolt of lightning shoots out from the remains of the strange ship, striking the very room you're standing in... but, instead of being electrocuted and fried to death, a hooded figure harmlessly manifests beside you. You recognize it as being identical to one of the ones you just fought, and prepare to defend yourself, but it makes no move against you. If anything, it seems to be repairing damage and helping around. You're not one to be lulled into a false sense of security, but... you're willing to trust this tentacled freak as long as it remains useful.": "",
  "(The Minister) \"Hah! To think they'd come at their own Hand...\"": "",
  "You ask him what's got him laughing, but he dismisses you completely before leaving the room, mumbling something about inferior beings. This guy's not very forthcoming, is he...": "",
  "Dear lord...": "",
  "You accept the hail, but the opposing ship doesn't have a camera feed. Instead, you're only given disturbing audio... a faint, heavy breathing from the other side. No, not breathing; growling. Is this their idea of a prank?": "",
  "Clear your throat and try to ask what they need.": "",
  "Despite your best efforts, you receive no answer from the other side of the call. It's just that rhythmic growling...": "",
  "I've had enough of this. Hang up the call.": "",
  "As you move to do so, you catch the briefest start of a hushed sentence, \"...succulent-\" Then, communications are cut as the strange ship whirs to life... they're moving in to attack!": "",
  "I've REALLY had enough of this. Attack!": "",
  "As you move to cut communications and begin your assault, you catch the briefest start of a hushed sentence, \"...succulent-\" Then, the strange ship whirs to life... they're moving in to attack as well!": "",
  "You're met with the visage of a human, terribly bloody and bruised. Before you can say a word, they put a finger over their mouth to signal that you should be quiet.": "",
  "Tilt your head to the side (to mimic confusion).": "",
  "The human points behind them, into the darkness, before running their thumb across their throat. You get the feeling that they're being held captive and need your help... they must be risking their life to make this call.": "",
  "(Teleporter) Nod, and flail your fingers around (to mimic teleportation).": "",
  "They don't quite understand your intention, but you're able to teleport them aboard all the same. As you do so, the lights come on over the call, and the strange ship begins to move... it seems your actions haven't gone unnoticed, as they're moving in to attack!": "",
  "Check on the human before preparing for battle.": "",
  "You pull the beaten human to their feet, and ask if they feel fine enough to fight. They nod, and move to take whatever position you need of them... do they know they don't still have to be quiet, or do they just like pantomiming?": "",
  "Put your hand up to your chin (to mimic thinking).": "",
  "You're so busy engaging in pantomime that you forget to actually think for a moment, but then it hits you... you just have to sneakily board the ship!": "",
  "Tighten your shoulders, raise your forearms and bob up and down (to mimic skulking).": "",
  "The human laughs at your ridiculous display, before immediately covering their mouth as the realization of what they've done washes over them. The last thing you see before the video feed dies is their look of terror as the lights come on behind them... then, the strange ship begins to move. It seems your involvement hasn't gone unnoticed, as they're moving in to attack!": "",
  "Ignore the signal, and ask them what's going on.": "",
  "A look of terror overtakes their face as the lights come on behind them, and the video feed dies. You blink a couple times, dumbfounded by your own actions. A few moments then pass, before the strange ship begins to move... it seems your involvement hasn't gone unnoticed, as they're moving in to attack!": "",
  "An electric shock runs through your hand as you accept the call, and an immense amount of power surges through it and into your systems somehow. You're expecting this to be some kind of virus, or maybe a cyberattack, but everything quickly returns to normal... if anything, it seems to have made things run MORE efficiently. You look outside, and, to your further confusion, the ship has vanished into thin air. What in the hell just happened...?": "",
  "For a moment, everything seems quiet, but then your systems start blaring as requests to hail are spammed. Looking at the space outside, you manage to spot a single ship far off in the distance. They don't seem to be moving... what could they want?": "",
  "Get closer and try to identify the ship.": "",
  "You fly in to get a good look at the ship, and they remain still as you do so. You recognize the make of the ship, but not the colors they fly... the hastily painted markings are reminiscent of the many pirate ships throughout the Multiverse, but you can't say you've seen these ones in particular before. As you observe the ship, many more dozens of requests to hail have since been sent.": "",
  "Accept the request.": "",
  "These guys sure are persistent... you'll teach them a thing or two about spamming a Renegade's systems! You move in further, your intentions clear, and the strange ship finally begins to move as they recognize your hostility... looks like you've picked a fight!": "",
  "Ignore the request, and the ship.": "",
  "This is likely just some amateur pirate trap... and you're no amateur! You put a good distance between you and the strange ship, and the requests to hail eventually go quiet.": "",
  "You don't know who's spamming you with requests to hail, but you really wish they'd be a little more considerate and not be so annoying about it. You put a good distance between you and the mystery ship, and the requests to hail eventually go quiet.": "",
  "If you do not defeat the Union ship in this amount of time, their esoteric ritual will be completed.": "",
  "The space outside warps as the civilians cry out one final, incomprehensible chant...": "",
  "...and it is done. With their ritual complete, a wave of destructive energy is sent out from the Union ship as it's torn apart, and a cloud of darkness fills the space outside. Some of this strange darkness manages to seep into the newly formed breaches in your ship - and you realize you've got company!": "",
  "You stopped the ship before they could complete their unknowable ritual, but you've dirtied your hands with Union blood nonetheless. It's hard to win, sometimes...": "",
  "To your surprise, it's a Union ship that greets you here. Well, to call it a greeting would be a bit of an exaggeration... it's more like, they hail, threateningly, and say \"Give us a human sacrifice or it's YOUR head that's rolling, Renegade!\" Not exactly a warm welcome...": "",
  "(Otherworldly Tome) I need them for my own purposes, you blabbering fool.": "",
  "Picking up on the reasoning behind the citizen's demands, you brandish the Otherworldly Tome for them to see.

  "A bit unconventional, but you teleport the Deep One in and out of your ship to heal it with your Reconstructive Teleporter.

Without you...\" it pauses, \"I'm afraid I would've... met my end in that wreck.\"": "",
  "I can't save it.": "",
  "The Deep One, having suffered too much trauma, dies mere moments later. With nothing left to do, you're forced to move on. Damn it all...": "",
  "Oh well, you tried. If they want help the least they can do is answer your calls... You turn away and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "You've got better things to be doing than saving people. You turn away and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Though the Deep Ones aren't here to thank you, you feel rather good about yourself as you scrap the Clansman ship.": "",
  "Once you're satisfied with what you've salvaged, the Clansmen hail you, \"Hope you weren't exxxxxpecting much in the way of thanksssss, Fed, that wasssss our mark. Ssssstill, not like they were going down easssssy...\" The Slug pauses for a second. \"Guesssss we'll be calling it even. Be ssssseeing you, Fed.\" With that, the Clansmen jump out of the beacon.

  "Miraculously, you manage to escape from the fight unscathed and find somewhere quiet to keep your distance while the FTL charges.": "",
  "Though your ship catches a few stray blasts, you manage to escape from the fight and find somewhere quiet to recuperate while the FTL charges.": "",
  "Your ship catches more crossfire than you would've liked, but you do manage to escape and find somewhere quiet to recuperate while the FTL charges.": "",
  "Upon arriving at the distress beacon, you're immediately greeted with the sight of shots whizzing past your window... You've dropped into the middle of a fight between two ships! It appears some Slug Clansmen must be on the hunt for Deep Ones for sport, and you'll have to pick a side fast unless you want to get caught in the crossfire.": "",
  "You face the Clansmen and prepare to attack. Deciding you're the bigger threat, they turn to face you. Meanwhile, the Deep One ship immediately seizes the opportunity to escape and leave the system. Suppose you won't be getting any thanks...": "",
  "Attack the Deep Ones.": "",
  "You face the Deep Ones and prepare to attack. Deciding you're the bigger threat, they turn to face you. Meanwhile, the Clansmen seem to have ceased firing; they're watching the fight from a distance. Suppose you won't be getting any help...": "",
  "Take your chances; try to escape.": "",
  "You arrive at the distress beacon, but the Deep One ship here quickly turns to face you, weapons charging; you've become the victim of an ambush. Though not typically malevolent, perhaps something's made these Deep Ones desperate... regardless, it's time to defend yourself!": "",
  "There's a Deep One settlement on a nearby moon here. You surmise that it must be the source of the distress call, but nothing seems immediately wrong from this distance.": "",
  "Get closer and investigate.": "",
  "Nothing seems out of the ordinary here. Ships are flying in and out at a regular pace and Deep Ones are casually roaming the streets undisturbed.": "",
  "Land and narrow down the source of the distress call.": "",
  "You land, immersing yourself in the surrounding Deep One architecture; a sea of blues and purples, complete with an excessive amount of blinding turquoise lights. The Deep Ones don't seem to mind your presence here, and eventually you home in on the source of the distress call. You're taken to a quiet corner of the settlement, one of the smaller houses at the end of the residential district. There still isn't anything that strikes you as an emergency as you stand at the door.": "",
  "Knock.": "",
  "No answer is made, and you can't hear any noise from inside.": "",
  "Knock again.": "",
  "This time, you knock much louder. Something shuffles around inside, but nobody comes to answer the door.": "",
  "Knock again...": "",
  "As you go to begin knocking a third time, the door is swung open; you're met with the sight of a dishevelled, old Deep One. It eyes you down, taking in your uniform before speaking, \"Federation, here... at my door? For... what purpose?\"": "",
  "There's a distress call emitting from inside your house.": "",
  "\"A d-\" The Deep One pauses briefly, taken aback. \"Excuse me... for a moment.\" It closes the door, and you hear further shuffling. It doesn't take long for it to return with a distress beacon in hand, though this one seems to be in a serious amount of disrepair. \"Is this... the source of the call?\"": "",
  "Indeed, that's a distress beacon.": "",
  "Obviously embarrassed, it responds \"My... goodness. This was sold to me by a... traveling Free Mantis salesman, who had claimed... it to be a 'De-Stress' beacon... Unless, I had just... misheard him.\" It thinks on this for a moment before continuing, \"I'm so... terribly sorry for troubling you, officer. I... wish there were any way I could make this... up to you, but, I don't think there is.\"": "",
  "(Deep One Crew) Maybe there is?": "",
  "Your Deep One whispers something to the older one before you, and a sense of dread seems to overcome its face. It nods, murmuring something in return, before closing the door and vanishing back inside. You ask your Deep One what that was about, but it hushes you and insists that you both wait a moment.": "",
  "We'll wait, then.": "",
  "After waiting for a while, the Deep One returns, a briefcase in hand. \"Let us go, then... if that is what they decree.\" It puts extra stress on the word they, and you raise an eyebrow, but your Deep One merely brushes it off. You all return to the ship, the old Deep One in tow, and it seems intent on joining your crew. You're not sure what was said to convince it to abandon everything it has going on here, but... you're not one to turn down new deckhands.": "",
  "(Free Mantis Crew) \"Do not doubts traveler-salesing!\"": "",
  "Your Free Mantis smacks the beacon in the Deep One's hand, and it suddenly emits a wave of soothing energy... wow, that IS de-stressing. Equally as amazed by this, the Deep One tries its best to speak amidst its sighs of relief, \"This... is wonderful... Here, take... this... It's the least... I can do to... repay this... immense favor...\" It slowly trudges back inside, its steps steeped in bliss, and it returns with a massive pile of goodies in hand... you're not sure if it's giving this stuff to you in its best mind, but you're not one to turn down hospitality. You accept the reward, bidding the Deep One farewell, and then begin your trek back to the ship.": "",
  "(Slug Crew) \"Heh, typical sssscam!\"": "",
  "Your Slug gives a hearty laugh, smacking the small device out of the Deep One's hands in the process, and it suddenly emits a wave of soothing energy... wow, that IS de-stressing. This wave seems to have the opposite effect on your Slug, as they scream and run back to the ship in horror, but you figure that they're probably just terrified of their own mechanically-gifted power. Equally as amazed by this, the Deep One tries its best to speak amidst its sighs of relief, \"This... is wonderful... Here, take... this... It's the least... I can do to... repay this... immense favor...\" It slowly trudges back inside, its steps steeped in bliss, and it returns with a massive pile of goodies in hand... you're not sure if it's giving this stuff to you in its best mind, but you're not one to turn down hospitality.

  "(Engineer Crew) Have your engineer inspect the beacon.": "",
  "Your engineer weighs the small device in their hands for a few moments, before giving it a decisive SMACK with their wrench. The beacon roars to life, and it suddenly emits a wave of soothing energy... wow, that IS de-stressing. Equally as amazed by this, the Deep One tries its best to speak amidst its sighs of relief, \"This... is wonderful... Here, take... this... It's the least... I can do to... repay this... immense favor...\" It slowly trudges back inside, its steps steeped in bliss, and it returns with a massive pile of goodies in hand... you're not sure if it's giving this stuff to you in its best mind, but you're not one to turn down hospitality. You accept the reward, bidding the Deep One farewell, and then begin your trek back to the ship.": "",
  "You wouldn't happen to have any... junk lying around, would you?": "",
  "\"...Junk?\" It looks around for a moment, before its gaze meets the beacon in its hands, \"This... would be junk, now, I... suppose.\" The Deep One hands it to you, apologizes again, and you make your way back onto your ship and out of the settlement. This was a big waste of time, for the most part, but you do get to break down the beacon and get the barest amount of something out of it...": "",
  "Enough of this, break the door down!": "",
  "As you move to break the door down, it's swung open; you're met with the sight of a dishevelled, old Deep One. It eyes you down, taking in your uniform before speaking, \"Federation, here... at my door? For... what purpose?\"": "",
  "Break the door down.": "",
  "What if there's an emergency in there? You don't have time to be standing around, idle! You throw yourself against the door, and it provides little resistance; it doesn't come down as much as you tear right through it. You begin pondering as to the logistics behind Deep One architecture, but your thoughts are quickly interrupted by the Deep One in front of you. Screaming in terror, it runs past you and through the hole you've just created. Suppose you won't get a chance to explain yourself...": "",
  "You spend a moment standing there dumbfounded, and you've only barely gotten back outside when alarms begin to blare around you! What was once a quiet street explodes into a hub of activity as Deep Ones escape their homes in panic. You had good intentions, but, it looks like things have quickly gotten out of control... and they're only going to get worse unless you get out of here quickly!": "",
  "It's time to leave!": "",
  "Besides the few looks of terror you catch, your sprint back to your ship generally goes unnoticed. However, as you make your ascent back into space, a Deep One ship begins to tail you; looks like you're not getting out of this without a fight... and to think, you were just trying to help!": "",
  "Must be a false alarm.": "",
  "Everything seems to be in order here. Satisfied, you turn away from the settlement and prepare to leave the system.": "",
  "You can't afford to be distracted, you have a mission to complete. Turning away from the settlement, you prepare to leave the system.": "",
  "You're still trying to process what just happened as another roar breaks out, this time all around you, and the space outside begins to... shift? An odd darkness envelops your ship, as realization dawns on you: some impossibly large THING is trying to swallow you whole. You aren't sure what it is, or what exactly's going on, but you know you've got to get out of here, and fast!": "",
  "Make a break for it!": "",
  "As you move to make your escape, the thing's tendrils crash into your ship, and more Soulplague Husks begin to flood in from the resulting breaches. They're trying to prevent your getaway!": "",
  "One of the Husks melts into a puddle on the floor before you, and you watch as its matter twists and writhes... as it takes on a new form. Rather than any being, though, it instead resembles some sort of oily weapon...": "",
  "What in the hell is going on...?": "",
  "Though you can't pinpoint why, you feel uneasy as you arrive at the distress beacon and are met with a Deep One ship. Its engines are off, but it otherwise appears to be powered... what exactly do they need help with?": "",
  "Hail the drifting ship.": "",
  "Your hail seems to automatically connect, but you're not quite sure what you're seeing. The screen is extremely dark, though not quite completely black, and you can't really make much out... save for some figures on the opposite side of the room. A strange gurgling can be heard over the call... you know Deep Ones can be weird, but are they typically THIS weird? If they're aware that they've been hailed, they don't seem to want to act on it. Or do much of anything, really. They're just standing there.": "",
  "(Soulplague Crew) Have your Soulplague-aligned crew member gurgle back.": "",
  "Your crew member mimics the odd gurgling, and the figures in the back of the room snap their heads to face the screen. You hear as one of them roars at you, to your bewilderment, before they all collectively sprint out of the room... then, their ship's engines roar to life! Whatever the hell's going on, they seem to be making a move on your ship. Get ready!": "",
  "As you're preparing for battle, a Soulplague Husk teleports into the room next to you, but you realize it isn't hostile... it seems intent on joining you. You weren't aware that Husks could perform mutinies, but you figure your crew member's gurgling somehow convinced it to do so. Still, its allies don't seem to be so agreeable!": "",
  "Clear your throat.": "",
  "You cough slightly, and the figures in the back of the room snap their heads to face the screen. You hear as one of them roars at you, to your bewilderment, before they all collectively sprint out of the room... then, their ship's engines roar to life! Whatever the hell's going on, they seem to be making a move on your ship. Get ready!": "",
  "Cut the call. This is weird.": "",
  "Indeed, you end communications with the strange Deep Ones and aren't once bothered by them as you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Attack the ship, before they realize you're here.": "",
  "You move to engage the Deep One ship, and readings from your ship's systems make you realize something is off... before you can hesitate, though, the opposing ship's engines roar to life! Whatever the hell's going on, they seem to be making a move on your ship. Get ready!": "",
  "Ignore them. If they want help, they can ask for it.": "",
  "And, yet... they don't ask for it. You're left completely undisturbed as you sit there, preparing to leave the beacon.": "",
  "The Deep One ship at this beacon doesn't take kindly to your sudden appearance and it turns towards you, weapons charging! They're typically not aggressors... Regardless of what's got them on edge, you have to defend yourself!": "",
  "Upon entering the system, you receive a hail; \"Federation, you... are not welcome here. This space... is sacred!\" You must be encroaching on their territory, and they see it fit to have you removed by force!": "",
  "A Deep One ship descends upon you, and you're sent a series of one-word messages that all say the same thing: \"TRIBUTE.\" Vague and ominous, but one thing's for sure; it's time for battle.": "",
  "A Deep One ship whizzes past your view, and hot on their tail is the Theocracy! Whether they think you're a bigger threat or an easier target is unclear, but, regardless of their reasoning, they focus their attention on you and allow the Deep One ship to escape. A thankless job, being a distraction...": "",
  "There's a Rock ship awaiting you at this beacon. Weapons primed, they charge towards you; it seems they're keen to prey on more than just the Deep Ones. Show them what happens when you try to prey on an apex predator.": "",
  "You receive a hail, \"Hah, it's nothing personal, Feddie. Crusades don't pay for themselves.\" With that, a Theocracy ship flies into view and prepares to engage.": "",
  "Thriving in the unruly conditions, pirate ships aren't uncommon in the vaguely controlled territory that is Deep One space. One comes at you now, weapons hot!": "",
  "There's a few pirate vessels gathered here. It's unclear what they're up to, and most of them flee at your sudden appearance, but one in particular seems confident in its ability to take you on; it approaches, ready to attack.": "",
  "In Deep One territory, it always pays to be wary, and you get the feeling that something's not quite right at this beacon. Whether it's preternatural instincts, or simply blind luck, seconds later, a pirate ship reveals itself from behind a nearby satellite and moves in to attack!": "",
  "The Rebels rarely travel through Deep One space themselves, but there's nothing stopping them from sending fleets of Auto-ships to do their dirty work for them. Likewise, there's nothing stopping you from making short work of them.": "",
  "Though empty, this beacon appears to be under watch by a Rebel Auto-ship. You're not sure why it's standing guard in territory belonging to the Deep Ones, let alone in empty space, but you're not given much of a chance to think about it; here it comes!": "",
  "\"Vessel detected. Identity: Federation. Location: Sector Deep-78314920746128...\" It continues for a while, before finally finishing, \"...62103. Protocol: Neutralization.\" With that, it bares its weapons and begins its assault.": "",
  "Lanius ships are crowding around a gigantic Deep One wreck present at this beacon. They've eaten around the lights, but it still appears to have plenty of metal left... they must not all be content with their meal, however; one of the ships breaks off from the wreck and decides you're its next feast!": "",
  "Unsurprisingly, the Lanius find Deep One sectors to be quite comfortable. Effectively lawless and unguarded save for the Deep Ones' settlements and fleets, the Lanius are practically free to roam and eat what they like. Unfortunately for you, that includes Renegades!": "",
  "You're hailed by a nearby Lanius ship whose translator seems especially lacking, \"Eaten need, not eat, eat. Thank.\" Moments later, their weapons go online and they begin their assault!": "",
  "The Deep Ones, as hot-headed as they are, still don't have complete disregard for their lives. They're offering a surrender.": "",
  "You receive several messages that are composed of complete gibberish and accompanied by bribes. You assume this is their idea of surrendering.": "",
  "The Deep Ones hail and struggle to speak your tongue, \"For...give... Please.\"": "",
  "In a moment of clarity, the Deep Ones forget their rage for but a moment and plead for their lives.": "",
  "As the opposing Deep One ship buckles and begins to collapse, you receive a desperate hail for surrender.": "",
  "Fear's not a look that well-suits the Deep Ones. Nevertheless, they cower before you, begging to be spared.": "",
  "Your scanners are picking up FTL signatures, the Deep Ones are trying to escape!": "",
  "As you scrap the strange ship, you muse to yourself that the Deep Ones would've been better off had they never left the water if the likes of you are all that awaits them in space.": "",
  "The Deep One ship sends one last hail as it splits into two, yet your translator can't even begin to decipher it.": "",
  "During the scrapping operation, your crew comments that the lights adorning the Deep Ones' hull appear to never die. You find that quite ironic.": "",
  "You pull up a database on Old Earth marine life as your crew scraps the ship. The Deep Ones have fine taste in ship architecture, yet they have finer scrap.": "",
  "Though you barely understand the creatures you've just blown up, you can't help but feel like it didn't have to end this way.": "",
  "You breathe a sigh of relief once it's been confirmed that the threat's been eliminated. There's a certain lingering dread that accompanies those in the presence of the Deep Ones...": "",
  "The ship breaks apart much more violently than you expected it to, sending cyan debris in all directions. Or was it turquoise?": "",
  "As you wander the halls of the strange ship, you muse to yourself that the Deep Ones would've been better off had they never left the water if the likes of you are all that awaits them in space.": "",
  "While cleaning out the ship you come across a dying Deep One who meets your gaze and mutters something before collapsing, yet your translator can't even begin to decipher it.": "",
  "During the scrapping operation, your crew comments that the lights adorning the Deep Ones' halls appear to never die. You find that quite ironic.": "",
  "You pull up a database on Old Earth marine life as your crew explores the now-empty ship. The Deep Ones have fine taste in ship architecture, yet they have finer scrap.": "",
  "Though you barely understand the creatures you've just slaughtered, you can't help but feel like it didn't have to end this way.": "",
  "You breathe a sigh of relief once it's been confirmed that the crew's been eliminated. There's a certain lingering dread that accompanies those in the presence of the Deep Ones...": "",
  "Amidst scrapping, your crew begins to argue about what color the lights the Deep Ones use are. Obviously they're turquoise, but you don't want to ruin their fun.": "",
  "You've put enough distance between you and the outpost, and no other guards appear to be following you. There's nothing left to do but prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "This beacon still appears to be under the control of the Harmony. A vast trading outpost floats in space nearby, though it's not without its small handful of guards.": "",
  "Despite these turbulent times of war, you dock into the outpost without much incident. Engi march in and out of port in synchronized marches, but none of them pay you any mind. You're free to look around and trade.": "",
  "You begin to move in to trade, but the outpost's guards quickly gather to form a blockade. One hails, \"Federation assessment: Harmony threat. Preparing neutralization.\" Not a very diplomatic people... you try to back off while you still can, but one of the guards breaks formation and begins to give chase!": "",
  "I'm not here to make friends. Attack the Harmony!": "",
  "Blasting into the outpost, you draw the ire of the guards, and they begin to give chase! You're able to break away from most of them, but one remains hot on your tail. It seems the only way out of this is a fight... but it's a fight you wanted!": "",
  "Stay low, and out of sight.": "",
  "You're able to successfully evade the guards' sight as you wait for the engines to charge.": "",
  "With the Harmony ship defeated, the Separatists express their gratitude and make their wares available to you.": "",
  "Pulling into the beacon, you recognize a common sight: a Separatist merchant vessel is here being harassed by a ship belonging to the Harmony. Suppose they don't really have to be part of any battle to be part of the war...": "",
  "You're able to hail the Harmony ship and grab their attention, \"Federation. Harmony Separatist reclamation in process: 2%. Inquiry: meaning behind Federation interruption.\"": "",
  "Can you, like, stop?": "",
  "It seems to ponder your statement for a moment, calculating a response, before soundly answering \"No.\"": "",
  "Well, I tried...": "",
  "Having tried absolutely everything within your power, you turn away from the two ships and prepare to leave the Separatists to their fate.": "",
  "I tried to do this peacefully. Eat lead, you damn machine!": "",
  "It doesn't appear to be immediately threatened by your battlecry, \"Possibility of eating lead: null. Likelihood of metaphorical meaning: high. Searching Old Earth metaphor database...\" it briefly pauses before jolting, startled, \"Threat: recognized. Eat weaponized ionic discharge.\" They turn towards you, ready to defend themselves from both your lead and your insults!": "",
  "(Engi Defender) \"Harmony Separatist reclamation process: reassigned.\"": "",
  "Your Defender continues, \"Separatist subjects: to be relinquished to Federation.\" The opposing Engi doesn't hesitate to do as its ordered for even a moment, pulling away from the Separatists and out of the system without another word. You're hailed by the merchant vessel, \"Federation, here to -save- us?\"": "",
  "Indeed. You're free to go, after you show me your wares.": "",
  "The Separatist's nanites vibrate with what you can only assume is joy. \"Oh, -thank- you [glorious] Federation! Wares! [Wares!]\"": "",
  "Nah. I just wanted to blow you up.": "",
  "\"What? [What?]\" You cut communications and get to work, though it takes very little effort to tear their ship apart... they really shouldn't be in the middle of a warzone without any defenses. That'll teach 'em! In, like, the next life. Assuming Engi have next lives. Or lives, in general.": "",
  "Eat lead, you damn machine!": "",
  "The Harmony ship turns to you, \"Federation threat detected. Harmony Separatist reclamation process: suspended.\"  There's no talking your way out of this one... prepare for battle!": "",
  "You're no hero. Or, maybe you are, just not for these guys. Or, maybe you just really like the Harmony? They've probably done plenty of good! Maybe the Separatists are the bad guys for, like, being different and choosing to fight over it! Or something... regardless, you ignore the two ships and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "The other ships have already gotten away. A pity, but you proved your might.": "",
  "A group of Disparity ships are huddled around this beacon. They don't really acknowledge your presence... they're likely busy trading amongst themselves.": "",
  "Try to get in on the action and trade.": "",
  "You try to hail the huddled ships, but they don't pick up. They mustn't fancy your presence here...": "",
  "Try hailing them again.": "",
  "Again, your hail goes unanswered.": "",
  "The call is abruptly picked up, \"[ALRIGHT!] We -get- it! If you meant to -hurt- us you would've done so already. Please: stop. You're -welcome- to trade.\" Hey! Persistence pays off.": "",
  "You've had enough. It's time to fight!": "",
  "You prime your weapons and the merchant, along with the majority of the ships, make a break for it. One stays behind, though, and prepares to meet you in battle. They hail, ironically, \"Take -pleasure- in this victory, if you must, Federation... but know -this.- I stand here for my [brothers.] You stand [alone.]\" Big words... let's see if they've guns to match!": "",
  "The ships gladly receive your hail, \"Federation [brothers!] Aren't you a -sight- for sore [VISUAL PROCESSORS.] Come, you're -welcome- to trade; we've goods aplenty!\"": "",
  "You know how to get their attention. Attack!": "",
  "You prime your weapons and the merchant, along with the majority of the ships, quickly notice your threatening presence and make a break for it. One stays behind, though, and prepares to meet you in battle. They hail, \"Take -pleasure- in this victory, if you must, Federation... but know -this.- I stand here for my [brothers.] You stand [alone.]\" Big words... let's see if they've guns to match!": "",
  "Ignore them, too.": "",
  "The ships keep to themselves, as do you. As the FTL drive charges, you find yourself staring into the brilliant crystalline armor encasing the nearby Disparity ships... beneath their luster, though, you swear you feel a sense of something murky laying within. Likely just your imagination...": "",
  "You may have defeated the Disparity ship directly on top of you, but you're still caught in the crossfire! Get out of here as soon as you can!": "",
  "After the Elite Harmony ship is defeated, you swiftly receive an encoded message directing you to a quiet cluster of asteroids just off the edge of the battlefield. There, you find a small group of Disparity ships hiding out of sight. One of the ships hails you, \"You made it! [HARMONY BASTARDS] be damned!\"": "",
  "You're the one carrying the Store beacon, I take it?": "",
  "The Disparity Engi laughs, robotically, \"You take -correctly.- Here to help my [brothers] on the frontlines. Repairs, fuel, -goods.- You need them? They're yours, my [brother,] as long as you have enough -scrap.-\"": "",
  "Let's trade, then.": "",
  "Help on the frontlines, you say...": "",
  "Their frame appears to shrink a little. \"Do you... think I could be doing -more- for my [brothers?] Is -mercantile- work not enough?\"": "",
  "Well... you could be helping them ON the frontlines.": "",
  "They sit in silence for a while. Calculating, perhaps? Eventually, though, they make their proclamation: \"Yes. [YES.] Federation [brothers] are right! I must -go!- To the frontlines!\" The Engi dematerializes before your very eyes and then reappears, now next to you, a mere couple seconds later. \"Onwards, [brother,] -captain!- To the frontlines!\" Onwards, indeed!": "",
  "No, forget I said anything. Let's trade.": "",
  "You were expecting something quaint, you know, merchant-like... but this is an active warzone! What sane merchant would be doing business here?": "",
  "You're in the middle of gathering your wits when a Disparity ship swoops in, weapons ready! Doubtful you'll be finding that merchant if they feel you're allied with the Harmony... not that that's what matters right now! Get ready for combat!": "",
  "You're in the middle of gathering your wits when a Harmony ship swoops in, weapons ready! Not just any Harmony ship, either, but an Elite... if you can get through them, maybe you can find that Disparity merchant. Get ready for combat!": "",
  "You continue to search through the remains of the Elite Crystal ship but don't find anything further of note. Alas... nothing remains. It's time to move on.": "",
  "Continuing to search through the remains of the Elite Crystal ship, you eventually come across a small cache! Unharmed in the battle, it appears to contain an Elite Crystal weapon and a small boon of resources.": "",
  "Pondering, the Sentinel takes a few moments to gather their thoughts. Finally, they speak, \"You seem to know a great deal more about this Crystalline tech than even I. If my goal is to uncover the truth behind the matter... I see no greater place to be than by your side.\"": "",
  "Lythill": "",
  "Of course, welcome aboard!": "",
  "On the way over, the Sentinel procures a weapon from their ship...": "",
  "...and the subject of their research, the Disparity Crystal Armor. Though currently fragmented, you find that the individual pieces are capable of resonating and melding with one another... perhaps mind-bogglingly, you could encase your entire ship in them if you so desired.": "",
  "Though you've seen a multitude of crystalline ships in this sector, true Crystal ships are few and far between... regardless of what brings them here, though, they're carrying a Store beacon.": "",
  "It's not just any Crystal who answers, but a Sentinel! Suppose you could've figured that from the design of the ship... \"Yes, greetings, Federation. I suppose you to be interested in trade.\"": "",
  "Indeed!": "",
  "The Sentinel groans, and allows you to peruse his wares. You can't help but wonder why a Crystal Sentinel is out here in Harmony territory, in the middle of a war, trading of all things... but you also suppose that it's not really your problem, is it?": "",
  "Yes, but... what brings you here?": "",
  "The Sentinel lowers his head, as if to stare a hole through yours, \"That is none of your concern. Trade, or leave.\"": "",
  "Alright, sure. Let's trade.": "",
  "(Crystal Crew) \"The captain means well. I'm curious as well, brother.\"": "",

These Separatists, the 'Disparity,' appear to have reappropriated vast amounts of Crystal technology. They claim otherwise, but the tech they're using is undoubtedly Crystalline in origin. Even still, it's been... changed, somehow.\"": "",
  "Changed?": "",
  "\"Yes, changed.\" The Sentinel shifts slightly, and they move to retrieve a shard of pink crystal that you recognize as being part of a Disparity ship's carapace. \"Perverted, even. Something writhes within. It's sentient, and angry, and nobody we can find has seen anything like it.\" Indeed, held up to the screen, you can see something... squirm. \"When released, it lashes out at anything it can find. Organic, or otherwise. It defies all explanation, and any attempts made to study its composition have failed.\" Perhaps someone onboard can shed some light on this...": "",
  "(Disparity Crew) Inquire.": "",
  "They seem hesitant to talk about it, but, after a bit of prodding, they do eventually open up. They claim the pink crystals to be a gift from the \"Liberator,\" a tool with which they are to defeat the Harmony, but they don't elaborate any further than that. It seems even the Disparity don't know the truth behind their own technology.": "",
  "(Deep One Cultist) Inquire.": "",
  "Though initially hesitant to share, your Enlightened Cultist appears fervent in their explanation of the matter. They claim the Dark One to have blessed this tech, Crystalline or not, and recognize the writhing mass within to be the very same as the darkness that makes up the Enlightened's grand void. Even still, the Enlightened have never received any such crystals. It seems that even they don't know the truth behind this dark technology...": "",
  "(Chosen Crew) Inquire.": "",
  "Though initially hesitant to share, your Chosen appears fervent in their explanation of the matter. They claim the Dark One to have blessed this tech, Crystalline or not, and recognize the writhing mass within to be the very same as the darkness that they utilize for their technology. Even still, the Chosen have never received any such crystals. It seems that even they don't know the truth behind this dark technology...": "",
  "(The Scarred) Inquire.": "",
  "Squinting at the screen, the Scarred examines the crystal. \"Perverted, indeed... by none other than... the False God. Darkness lies within... as it does in all things... the False God touches. Engi... with dark Crystalline tech. It bears a parallel with... my kin, and their reliance on... similarly dark Engi tech. One must... ask the question: does the False God trade technology... between its followers?\" An interesting thought... the full truth, though, remains elusive.": "",
  "(The Minister) Inquire.": "",
  "The Minister examines the crystal for a time, deep in thought, before turning away from the screen and back to you, \"This would undoubtedly be the Tempest's work, but even I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like it. Considering the Seraphim's involvement in this sector, I must raise the possibility that the Disparity has been gifted these strange crystals from... beyond our cluster's seams.\" An interesting thought... the full truth, though, remains elusive.": "",
  "(The Overseer) Wait a minute...": "",
  "You've seen these shadow-crystals before - in the Antumbral Plane. They were a construct of the Plane's Shadows, utilized by the Archangel Protocols in the name of self-defense. Still, to the layman, that all sounds insane... and you've no clue how it's ended up in the Disparity's hands. You try your best to offer the Crystal what information you know on the mysterious, dark armor - without sounding crazy.": "",
  "(Seraphim Crew) Inquire.": "",
  "Divine flames coil around your Seraph as they speak, as if in defense, and they explain in few words how the crystal has not only been changed by the Dark God, but tainted by it. They seem insistent that you allow them to purify the shard at once, but your thoughts linger on their words... tainted. Another word for perverted, you suppose, but it also begs the question: what exactly has it been tainted by? The blatant answer would be darkness, but darkness isn't a real THING. Not truly, anyways, which means there's some other truth to the strange matter the Dark God appears to manipulate. Still, any sort of 'purification' by your Seraph wouldn't exactly shed light on the situation... it seems the truth of the matter must remain a mystery for now.": "",
  "Personally? I have no idea.": "",
  "The Sentinel sighs, \"No, I suppose you wouldn't. Keep this matter to yourself, and... thank you for allowing me to get it off my chest. Feel welcome to still trade.\"": "",
  "Fine! I'll leave then!": "",
  "Communications are cut, and you're left in silence. The nerve of some people! Is it truly a crime to be curious these days?": "",
  "How about I just blow you up?": "",
  "Now THIS is one pissed off Crystal. If looks could kill, this Sentinel's furious gaze certainly would have by now. Still, they can't, so they're left to rebut, \"Alien bastards! This is why you are not to be trusted. You want a fight? You'll have one. May it be your last.\" With that, they cut communications... you best prepare to finish what you've started.": "",
  "Nah, I just wanted to say hi before attacking you. Hi.": "",
  "The Sentinel slams their mighty fist and scowls, \"Alien bastards! This is why you are not to be trusted. You want a fight? You'll have one. May it be your last.\" With that, they cut communications... you best prepare to finish what you've started.": "",
  "You ignore the Crystal ship, and they ignore you. If there's one thing the Crystals and the rest of the universe can agree on, at least it's that one should respect mutual silence...": "",
  "It appears that the Disparity wreckage was heavily damaged during the battle. Nothing of use remains.": "",
  "It appears that the rest of the Disparity wreckage was heavily damaged during the battle. Nothing of use remains.": "",
  "Inspecting the Disparity wreckage, you find quite a few valuable resources that the Crystals seem to have overlooked in their search.": "",
  "Inspecting the Disparity wreckage, you're surprised to find a living Disparity Elite, powered down and in Hazard mode. Upon taking them aboard, you're able to wake them up, \"F-F-F-F-Federation... s-s-s-saved me. Thank y-y-y-you, [b-brother.]\" Though still low on power, they'll recover in due time... and, as a show of thanks, they even offer to join your crew!": "",
  "Inspecting the Disparity wreckage, you find a ship that's not nearly as damaged as the others... as if aware of your scrutiny, the ship springs to life, weapons hot! Seems like they're interested in blasting first, and asking questions later!": "",
  "A smile creeps across the Crystal's (uncomfortably close) face, \"Yeah... I reckon ya' ta' be thieves, alright. Thieves and mutts, all of ya'! I'll show you what we da' ta' no-good thieving mutts!\" Communications are abruptly cut. Moments later, their ship turns to yours... weapons charging! Get ready!": "",
  "The Crystal backs off slightly, \"Nah, I don't reckon ya' ta' be thieves at all. Da' forgive me for the, uh, scrutiny. I'll be on ma' way.\" After ending communications, they leave the system, and you're left alone with the Disparity wrecks.": "",
  "Inspect the wreckage.": "",
  "Off in the distance, you're met with the surprising visage of a Crystal ship... exceedingly rare in any space other than their own, let alone in the middle of an active Engi warzone. They appear to be inspecting a few of the abandoned Disparity ships wrecked nearby.": "",
  "Let's say hello!": "",
  "Hailing the ship, the Crystal at the helm seems less than pleased to be talking with you. \"FEDERATION? Ya' here to take what's ours, too? Or, are ya' merely in cahoots with these thieves? Ya' their war dog, mutt?\" Most Crystals you meet are typically well-mannered... nevermind well-spoken.": "",
  "Calm down. Who's stealing what?": "",
  "They roll their Crystalline eyes and get real close to the screen, \"Are ya' BLIND, Fed? Ya' never seen one of 'em Dispari-whatever ships? CRYSTAL! Smothered in the damn stuff... spoken ta' a few of 'em myself. Claim it's from their grand 'liberator' or whatever, but I know the damn truth. I recognize Crystalline tech when I see it. Just like I recognize damn thieves...\" Their face is practically pressed against the screen now as they eye you down head to toe.": "",
  "(Crystal Crew) \"You'd claim your own to be thieves?\"": "",
  "The opposing Crystal immediately backs off from the screen at the sight of your crew member. \"Ah, uh, my apologies, brother. Da' forgive my, uh... rudeness. I'll be on ma' way.\" After ending communications, they leave the system, and you're left alone with the Disparity wrecks.": "",
  "(Disparity Crew) \"The [LIBERATOR] is no -thief.-\"": "",
  "The Crystal stomps their feet, slamming their desk, \"Ya' harbor THIEVES, Fed?! They're even spoutin' their damn zealotry! Ya' really are their damn mutt... and I'll show ya' how we deal with mutts.\" Communications are abruptly cut. Moments later, their ship turns to yours... weapons charging! Get ready!": "",
  "(Crystalline Weapon) Oh, yeah. Big thief here.": "",
  "\"Ya' DAMN little-\" The Crystal punches the screen, and communications are abruptly cut. Moments later, their ship turns to yours... weapons charging! Get ready!": "",
  "Gulp...": "",
  "I'll show you who's the mutt!": "",
  "The Crystal chuckles, \"Oh? Mutt's got some bite ta' go along with its bark...\" they pause, and grin, \"...let's see how long that lasts.\" Communications are abruptly cut. Moments later, their ship turns to yours... weapons charging! Get ready!": "",
  "Let's blast them!": "",
  "The Crystal ship quickly recognizes your aggression and moves to meet you in combat.": "",
  "Let's do nothing!": "",
  "Indeed, you do nothing. The Crystal ship keeps to the wreckage, and you're given some time to yourself while the FTL drive charges.": "",
  "You may have defeated the Disparity ship directly on top of you, but you're still being fired upon by the approaching fleet! Get out of here as soon as you can!": "",
  "You move your pawn. \"[Woah!] Truly: a -tactical- move... alright, it is: -my- turn.\" A few moments pass as the Disparity Elite considers their first move. Then, abruptly, a laser is fired from one of their floating shoulder cannons... and your side of the board is obliterated. \"Wow! [Wow!] I: win? I: [won!]\"": "",
  "Hey! That's cheating!": "",
  "\"[Cheating?] Did I -not- follow: the rules?\" They seem genuinely perplexed. \"What was I -supposed- to: do?\"": "",
  "Explain the game.": "",
  "You explain the rules and intricacies of chess at length, even going over a few of the simpler commonly practiced openings and plays. Throughout the entire explanation, the Disparity Elite remains quiet, but focused.": "",
  "Once you're finished explaining, the Disparity Elite looks thoughtfully at the chess board. Finally, minutes later, they make a move: pawn to B6. \"[Okay!] Your: turn!\" What remains of your side of the chess board is still smoldering.": "",
  "You, uh, destroyed my pieces before.": "",
  "They look back down at the board, \"[Oh.] So I -did.- It seems like I still have much to learn: about chess...\" gazing back up at you, their visor glimmers in the light, \"...and I know: no greater teacher than: -you.- I will accompany: you, and learn: -all- I can! Lead: the way, [teacher!]\" With that, the Disparity Elite beams over, and you find yourself appointed the title of Chess Teacher!": "",
  "Make the rules up.": "",
  "You explain how obliterating the opponent's side of the board via laser-fire is actually one of chess' most classic mates, but that it's solely a move reserved for when the opponent's king is in check. Playing it without meeting the proper conditions means one must forfeit the match and agree to financially compensate their opponent for their own incompetence.": "",
  "The Disparity Elite seems to think this over before nodding, \"I had [no] idea I was breaking: the rules, nor do I intend: to disrespect: them further. Of -course- I will compensate: you, and, hopefully, we can -both- move: past this as my chess career [blossoms.]\" They beam your 'compensation' over, and it looks like you're free to go, no questions asked... hopefully the consequences of the birth of Laser Chess don't come back to haunt you.": "",
  "The Disparity appears to already have control of this beacon. Upon arriving, one of their ships approaches you and hails, \"-Listen.- I don't care who you are, or who you're [against.] I [NEED] to share: something with: someone.\"": "",
  "Alright...": "",
  "Vibrating rapidly, the Disparity Elite continues, \"Searching through: an Old Earth database I uncovered: something [grand.] It's a -game,- older than: time, but my [brothers] refuse: to play: it with me... they're all focused on: the -war- and such. So, I was wondering... would you be: -interested- in: playing?\"": "",
  "Sure, I'm interested.": "",
  "\"Oh, [marvelous!]\" they retreat momentarily to retrieve something, hopping excitedly the whole way there and back, \"The people of: Old Earth called this game [CHESS.]\" Indeed, the Disparity Elite holds a chess board atop a cloud of their nanites. They've got the pieces and everything. \"I've very -little- clue as to: the rules. Figured I'd: learn as I go: along. You go: [first!]\" Alright, you can do this... you can play chess. You fight for you life in a race to save the Multiverse every day, of course you can play chess. Just, uh...": "",

  "The Disparity Elite ceases its vibrations and shrinks slightly, \"[Oh.] Guess we -will- have to: fight, then...\" With you having no time for games, they cut communications and prepare to meet you in battle. Be careful, they've ordered the rest of the Disparity fleet to fire upon you!": "",
  "The Disparity Elite ceases its vibrations and shrinks slightly, \"[Oh.] That's: okay. Thank: you, anyways.\" They seem rather disheartened... alas, you tell yourself you have no time for games as you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Cut communications and attack.": "",
  "You're not interested in whatever it is the Disparity has to say. You cut communications and prepare for hostilities, and, recognizing this, the opposing ship orders the rest of the Disparity fleet to fire upon you!": "",
  "The Zoltan mercenary hails, desperately, consoles blaring behind them, \"Alright, alright, I get your point! I'm still blowing those Separatists up, but, like, how about I pay you, or something! Anything!\"": "",
  "Leave the Disparity outpost be, or you're the only one who's being blown up.": "",
  "They slam a nearby console, \"If I do that, then it's going to be the Harmony that kills me! We made a deal that I can't just... back out on.\"": "",
  "Come with me, then. You'll have to work, but the Harmony won't be able to reach you.": "",
  "\"I...\" they pause, \"...no, I can't live honorably. Not now... not after all I've done...\" again, another pause, \"...maybe I can still die honorably, though. To arms, Fed!\" Well, you tried. Hopefully that accounts for something...": "",
  "So be it.": "",
  "As if! Prepare to atone for your misdeeds!": "",
  "With the mercenary defeated, you return to the Disparity outpost and inform them that they're free to return to the surface once more. Elated, they do just that, and you watch as Separatists and Disparity Elites alike pour out from hidden passages to occupy the outpost and begin to return it to its former glory.": "",
  "All in a day's work.": "",
  "You turn to leave, but one of the Disparity Elites you had initially spoken with stops you. \"[Brother.] [LIBERATOR.] We -thank- you: more than you can know. We would like: to -offer- you a [gift.] A token of: our -appreciation.- A token from: the [LIBERATOR.]\" They usher you aside, down a discreet alleyway, and into one of the hidden passages that you were told led underground. Stepping inside, though, you aren't just met with darkness. You feel as your body wades through some kind of liquid-like barrier, and into a sort of physical blackness that you can only describe as being... wet.": "",
  "Wet... and warm. You feel embraced. Loved, even. Within this blackness, thoughts rush to your mind. Alien thoughts. Thoughts of weapons, of schematics... of darkness. You feel that to receive your gift, you must simply embrace one of these thoughts, as they embrace you.": "",
  "Embrace the fleeting thought... in your mind, it resembles a laser weapon.": "",
  "You embrace the thought, and your desire is made manifest. You leave this ethereal space, weapon in hand, and make for your ship... but these foreign thoughts don't leave your mind. You won't be sleeping easily tonight.": "",
  "Embrace the piercing thought... in your mind, it resembles a bomb weapon.": "",
  "Embrace the overwhelming thought... in your mind, it resembles a flak weapon.": "",
  "Embrace the droning thought... in your mind, it resembles a combat drone.": "",
  "You embrace the thought, and your desire is made manifest. You leave this ethereal space, drone in hand, and make for your ship... but these foreign thoughts don't leave your mind. You won't be sleeping easily tonight.": "",
  "Embrace the comforting thought... in your mind, it resembles an anti-personnel drone.": "",
  "Embrace... no, this isn't right! Break free!": "",
  "This is wrong, deeply wrong. Something... otherworldly is at work here. Not just in this space, but within YOU. You feel an overwhelming desire to escape, and, gathering every ounce of strength within your being, you manage to tear yourself free from the void's embrace. The Disparity Elite outside looks displeased, but only mildly. \"You -will- return: in due time. We [all] do.\" With that, they walk away, and you're left alone... battered. Tainted.": "",
  "Try to gather yourself.": "",
  "Yourself... yourself. What IS your self?": "",
  "I'm... a Renegade.": "",
  "Right... a Renegade, tasked with saving this reality from the Rebellion. Who else would you be? You push your thoughts aside, and make for your ship. It's time to leave this godforsaken beacon.": "",
  "\"NO... YOU'RE JUST A PUPPET.\"": "",
  "The voice continues, \"A PUPPET... OF SOMETHING GREATER. GREATER THAN I, OR ANY OF US. YOU DESIRE... NOTHING. IT IS THE PUPPETMASTER'S PLACE TO DESIRE. IT IS THE PUPPET'S PLACE TO ACT. SO, GO.

  "You perform a massive scan that spans this entire half of the moon's surface, and, as you expected, several Disparity Elites appear to be teleporting around sporadically in a futile attempt to hide.": "",
  "Realizing they've been caught, the Disparity Elites all collectively teleport into your ship... it seems they don't trust you! Prepare to defend yourself!": "",
  "Realizing they've been caught, the Disparity Elites all collectively teleport into your ship, next to you.

  "I swear to you, I mean no harm. Why are you hiding?": "",
  "Though still hesitant, the group's posture collectively relaxes a little. \"[HARMONY BASTARDS] hunt us -even- still. More of us remain: underground, in hiding, waiting for the -coast- to be clear.\"": "",
  "Is the coast not clear? I haven't seen any Harmony around.": "",
  "A different one speaks, \"It is not: the [HARMONY] you should be -looking- for. They have employed: a [Zoltan] mercenary to -bombard- our streets. We have little: means of -penetrating- their [Energy Shield,] and as long as they live, we -cannot- know [peace.]\"": "",
  "I'll deal with the Zoltan ship.": "",
  "\"-Truly?-\" You nod, and the Disparity Elites' nanites collectively reverberate with what you can only assume is newfound hope. \"They are not: -far- from here. We've managed to: [track] their movements, and know the -general- area in which they now [lie in wait.] Go there, and: return when the -deed- is done.\"": "",
  "I'll be back soon, then.": "",
  "Leaving the moon, you begin to search the general area the Disparity Elites outlined to you. Though it'll likely take a while, you feel it necessary to do what you can for these people.": "",
  "Some time passes as you search, until a blip on your scans catches your eye. Following it, you're indeed led to a Zoltan ship. They hail as you approach, \"Ah, Federation! What brings you to this, uh, extremely specific and remote location?\"": "",
  "I'm here to beat your ass, merc.": "",
  "\"Beat my- ha! Haha! Oh, those dastardly Separatists put you up to this, didn't they? Ever the hero, you Fed types... though, if they'd simply taken a hint from the repeated bombings and left, I wouldn't have to still be here, would I?\" the Zoltan sighs, \"Oh, well. I'll reduce the entire place to rubble if I have to... after I deal with you.\" Their weapons, previously concealed, spring to life! Get ready!": "",
  "I have some intel that may interest you...": "",
  "\"Really, now?\" Piquing the Zoltan's interest, you inform them of the fact that the survivors of the Disparity outpost are hiding underground, waiting for the coast to be clear. \"You don't say...\" he sighs, \"...looks like I've still got my work cut out for me. Reducing that pitiful settlement to rubble oughta do the trick.\" They let out a hearty laugh.": "",
  "\"Here, take this.\" They press a button, and a Disparity drone is beamed directly to your hold. \"For your troubles. Those dastardly Separatists launched it at me back before they realized they were entirely defenseless and in need of saving.\" With that, the Zoltan ship zooms off to further assault the Disparity outpost, and you get the feeling that you shouldn't return...": "",
  "Sorry, but I can't help you.": "",
  "\"Then we shall: -have- to return to [hiding.] Farewell, [brother.]\" The Disparity Elites teleport back to the surface of the moon, and you can't help but feel bad for them... still, you don't have time to be chasing ships around. At least, that's what you tell yourself as you turn away from the moon and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Intruders! Attack!": "",
  "Agitated, the Disparity Elites switch to Attack form, \"We thought you: our [brother.] You're -nothing- but: a [monster,] like the rest.\" A monster, maybe, but teleporting onto other people's ships without permission is just rude! Prepare to defend yourself!": "",
  "There doesn't appear to be a whole lot at this beacon, save for a nearby moon. You notice a few signs of Disparity occupation localized at a single location on its surface, but you can't tell if there's been any recent activity. For all you know, it might be a ghost town.": "",
  "Approach the moon's surface and investigate.": "",
  "Getting closer to the Disparity outpost, you still can't find any signs of life. Preliminary scans of the area read back, for the most part, negative, though... you notice a few oddities deemed false positives dotted throughout the results. Several of the scans have caught extremely momentary readings of life, lasting mere milliseconds.": "",
  "(Slug Crew) Your Slug feels that something is off.": "",
  "Your Slug explains that there is indeed life within the outpost, though it appears to be rapidly teleporting around in an attempt to avoid your scans. Sounds like the Speed form of the Disparity Elites... perhaps taking a much larger scan of the entire area simultaneously will force them to reveal themselves.": "",
  "(Adv. Sensors) Take an extremely large scan of the area.": "",
  "(Long-Ranged Scanners) Take an extremely large scan of the area.": "",
  "We're not really capable of such a scan.": "",
  "Though the outpost contains life, it's unlikely that you'll find anyone even if you land seeing that they're this efficient at evading your scans. Defeated, you turn away and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "(Telepathic Shell) Your Shell feels that something is off.": "",
  "Your Shell explains that there is indeed life within the outpost, though it appears to be rapidly teleporting around in an attempt to avoid your scans.

  "Odd, but there's nothing we can do.": "",
  "With there being nothing here for you, you retreat from the abandoned outpost and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "You don't have time to be scanning random moons. Confident in your time-saving abilities, you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "With their Elite soundly defeated, the rest of the fleet hesitates. Here's to hoping they buy the bluff...": "",
  "Cross your fingers.": "",
  "To your immense relief, the fleet begins to back off! Even though they likely had the numbers to take you down, it seems the Harmony deemed the possible Engi casualty-count to be too great to go through with it. We'll see how much trouble that will save them in the long run, at the pace you're keeping...": "",
  "Contact the Disparity ship.": "",
  "They appear to be shocked by the whole ordeal, \"You [single-handedly]: managed to drive off an -entire- Harmony fleet through -nothing- but sheer [strength.]  You are: -most- unusual.\" The Engi, joined by its companions, kneels down, \"Yet, we: owe our -lives- to this unusual one. [LIBERATOR.] Allow us: to lend you -our- aid in [return.]\" Remaining kneeled, the Disparity Elite and its fellow Engi join in song... it's a robotic drone, unpleasant to your ears, yet underneath it you hear something...": "",
  "No, you don't hear it... you FEEL it. It's an overwhelming feeling... one reminiscent of an embrace, long overdue. It envelops you, and everything, and you're left drifting... no, sinking. You sink deeper into this feeling for what must be an eternity, as time, and everything, becomes nothing. Nothing... were you ever more?": "",
  "Yes, I was everything.": "",
  "Everything... no, you weren't. You were always nothing, never capable of being anything more. Looking into a mirror, it was everything that stared you back, and, were you capable of realization, you would've realized it was you who was the reflection. A reflection of everything's choices, of everything's desires... yes, you were never anything more than the nothing that is everything's. Yet, it is through your existence as nothing that everything is allowed to be. Were you something, anything, everything would cease to be. Everything exists at nothing's behest.": "",
  "My behest...": "",
  "At least, on paper. Nothing, beholden by everything, may never behest anything of everything. It is at everything's behest that nothing be nothing, and not something, anything or everything. Nothing exists at everything's behest. Amongst a Multiverse of nothings, everything must be everything for anything to be everything. Do you see now, nothing, what it is that you desire?": "",
  "Nothing... desires to be everything.": "",
  "You jolt awake, your back sore from... why WERE you sleeping on the ground? Getting up, and gathering your bearings, you realize you have no idea where you are. It's been some time since you must have fallen asleep...": "",
  "Wandering the ship, things get even stranger. Scrap has spontaneously appeared in your hold, and damage to the hull has miraculously healed. Weirdest of all, a stranger walks amongst your crew. They claim they've always been here, for everything... and though you swear you don't recognize them, the rest of the crew corroborates their story. The stranger speaks up, \"Just how -hard- did you: hit your head, [captain?] We can't have you: tripping over [nothing] and -dying- while the future of [everything] is at stake.\" Right. You have a duty to uphold, Renegade, and you aren't going to let even the most bizarre of circumstances stop you. Onwards!": "",
  "Nothing": "",
  "In self-preservation, the Elite jumps away... leaving you with a fleet of hostile ships wholly underwhelmed by your attempt at striking fear into their metallic hearts. The Disparity ship is a lost cause now, and you will be as well if you don't get out of here as soon as possible!": "",
  "As you defeat the forerunner of the Harmony fleet, you catch a glimpse of the Disparity ship leaving the beacon out of the corner of your eye. That's your cue to get out of here! They may be unable to directly reward you, but you saved lives today... allow that to be its own reward.": "",
  "A grisly sight awaits you at this beacon... dozens, if not hundreds, of Disparity ships lie in ruin as the Harmony fleet advances through this territory. At the head of the fleet, you notice one Disparity ship still fighting, despite being wholly outnumbered...": "",
  "Is there anything we can do to save it?": "",
  "The odds weigh immensely in the Harmony's favor, and while the Disparity ship is holding its own for now, the threat of it being swarmed is inevitable. You would need come up with and execute a brilliant strategy, and quickly.": "",
  "Examine the situation.": "",
  "Observing the Harmony fleet, you notice only one Elite ship amongst their ranks. Surmising them to be the head of this regiment, one can assume that their destruction may impede the fleet, but... it's not any Elite the lower-ranking Engi are taking orders from. You would need a way of convincing the Harmony program itself to stop the advance.": "",
  "Perhaps you can fight your way through this.": "",
  "Perhaps, yes, but... which angle should you take? Should you attempt to reach the Elite, in the middle of the fleet, or head straight to the frontlines and provide cover for the Disparity ship directly? If you decide to head to the Elite, you'll need a way of getting through the fleet without being blasted to bits.": "",
  "Head for the Elite.": "",

  "(Adv. Engines) Gun it!": "",
  "Maneuvering through the Harmony fleet, you don't make it through unscathed, but you were able to evade the vast majority of incoming attacks. Now face to face with the Harmony Elite, you'll need to defeat it quickly and soundly if you are to scare the Harmony into calling off its assault.": "",
  "This is the time you have until the Elite Harmony ship retreats and your bluff fails.": "",
  "(Cloaking) Sneak through!": "",
  "Sneaking through the fleet, you're able to make it through unscathed as the Harmony briefly loses sight of you. Now face to face with the Harmony Elite, you'll need to defeat it quickly and soundly if you are to scare the Harmony into calling off its assault.": "",

  "(Adv. Weapons.) Blast a path through!": "",
  "Brute-forcing your way through a fleet of Engi isn't easy, and while you do manage to carve a path via overwhelming firepower, you take a substantial amount of damage yourself.

  "(Defense Drone) Drone power, go! [-1|]": "",
  "Relying on your defense drone, you're able to get through the fleet relatively unscathed... though the enemy's overwhelming firepower does break through at a couple points.

  "Hope for the best...": "",
  "With no plan, you rush brazenly through a massive horde of aggressive Engi ships... and though you do make it through, you take a massive amount of damage in the process.

  "Head for the frontline.": "",
  "Racing for the frontline, you swiftly place yourself between the approaching fleet and the Disparity ship. Catching on to your bold display, they begin charging their FTL drive... you only have to buy them a little bit of time!": "",
  "Nevermind, we can't afford to risk this. Give up.": "",
  "The risk is too great, particularly to save the lives of just one ship. Leaving the Disparity to their fate, you're able to find a quiet spot where you won't grab the fleet's attention as you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Perhaps you can get through this with diplomacy.": "",
  "Perhaps, yes, but... which angle should you take? Should you appeal directly to the Elite, making a point of allowing yourself to be vulnerable, or use diplomacy as a cover and head straight for the Disparity ship to get them out of here discreetly? Keep in mind that, in either case, you'll need good standing with the Harmony, and if you plan on heading straight for the Disparity ship then you'll need a plan to get them out of here without drawing the fleet's attention.": "",
  "Try to reason with the Elite.": "",
  "Hailing the fleet, you request a direct audience with the Elite. Confused, one of the lower-ranking Engi responds, \"Federation directive: unclear. Engi: Harmony. Engi Defender: Harmony.

  "(Teleporter) While I distract the Harmony, you'll sneak onto my ship.": "",
  "They'll lose their ship, but at least they'll keep their lives... and be capable of having some use to you. They agree to the plan, and forward their crew's signatures for teleportation. Now, to distract the fleet...": "",
  "Hail the Harmony fleet.": "",
  "An agitated Engi responds, \"Federation. Request: reasoning for Harmony fleet impediment.\" You're going to have to make something up... as you do, though, you begin teleporting in the Disparity members.": "",
  "I, uh... have you read these Separatists their rights?": "",
  "They seem to think for a moment, calculating, \"Error: Engi rights: null. Federation impediment: illogical.\" Another Disparity member is teleported in... there's only one left.": "",
  "No, not their rights, their writes!": "",
  "This one really stumps them. \"Illogical homophone detected. Separatist literature: forbidden by Harmony. Harmony demand: cease Federation impediment of Harmony forces. Patience: approaching null.

There's no reason to protect their ship anymore.": "",
  "Move out of the way.": "",
  "The Harmony seems annoyed with you, but not aggressively so. You move your ship out of the way, and the Disparity ship is fired upon and reduced to rubble.

All I know is that you: -did,- and with our ship [destroyed,] I see -no- greater course of action than to [help] you: as you: have [helped] us, [captain.]\" They respect you... make sure not to let them down.": "",
  "You're going to have to prepare to jump while I distract the Harmony.": "",

  "Our standing with the Harmony is rather poor... they're unlikely to listen to us.": "",
  "Indeed. It would be a fool's errand to try... unwilling to fight, and incapable of resolving the situation peacefully, you're left with no choice but to leave the Disparity ship to its fate.": "",
  "Yeah, no. Nevermind.": "",
  "Honestly? Yeah. Screw this, dude. The hell have any Separatists ever done for us? They really expect us to take on a whole ass Harmony fleet to save a single ship? Like, lower your expectations, assholes. Or, at the very least, do the same for us sometime. Not that they'll really get a chance to if you, uh, leave them to die. Oh well.": "",
  "Getting involved would be a suicide mission.": "",
  "Indeed, and we're on no suicide mission. Or, at the very least, the suicide mission we're on concerns the fate of an entire reality, and not a single Disparity ship. Sometimes you've got to weigh your priorities, and this is simply one of those times.": "",
  "The remains of the Lanius ship join those of the Engi, and everything is quiet once more. Hopefully, no more battles will ever have to be fought here, and those who have fallen may, in death, claim the peace they sought in life.": "",
  "Though you're accustomed to war, beholding it in its true form of not glory, but carnage and suffering, can on occasion take its toll on you... surrounding the space around you are the ruins of innumerable Engi ships, both of the Harmony and the Disparity, likely left here in the wake of some gargantuan battle.": "",
  "Reflect on the slaughter.": "",
  "Innumerable ships... innumerable lives, extinguished in the name of civil war. Though they fight for what they believe in, you can't help but wonder if this is truly what it takes to free the Engi people. After being separated from the Harmony, will the Engi come to appreciate their blood-soaked liberators serving a higher power just as they had? Or will the war rage on evermore, until only one side remains? Only one set of ideals, either the sanctity and safety of living in Harmony, or the freedom to do as you see fit and embrace the Disparities between each other, will remain at the end of this path carved in blood.": "",
  "Are we much better?": "",
  "As you reflect, your ship detects movement outside, and you realize that it is within paths carved in blood that leeches fester. A nearby Lanius ship cruises from wreck to wreck in search of scrap to eat... of remains to desecrate. With the war raging on, it's inevitable that even unfamiliar outsiders can slip into Harmony territory unhindered.": "",
  "This is an outrage. Demand that the Lanius ship leave.": "",
  "Angrily, you hail the Lanius ship and make your demands known. They stare through you in an unsettling way only the Lanius could... then, \"Understand. No feed, precious feed.\" Well, that was easy.": "",
  "Turn to leave.": "",
  "You're prepared to begin leaving the beacon, satisfied, when... you realize the Lanius have immediately returned to stripping the Engi ships for what scrap they can. The nerve! Hailing them once more, they defend themselves, \"No feed! Save feed, later. No waste precious.\" As if that's any better!": "",
  "(Lanius Crew) Have your Lanius better convey your words.": "",
  "Nodding, your Lanius turns to the screen, \"No save feed, no feed, no maybe feed, no little feed. Precious no feed, no precious feed.\" The opposing Lanius stares back, perhaps thoughtfully, \"Apology. Thought no feed, precious feed. Know no precious feed now. Take no precious feed, apology. Leave now.\" With a hint of regret in their odd voice, they apologize and beam over what they had taken from the scrapping operation before promptly leaving the beacon. I guess it's too late to put it back now... may as well put this tainted scrap to good use. Not like it'll be the first time, or the last.": "",
  "I'm tired of this. Attack the Lanius!": "",
  "Not only are they disrespecting the remains of the Engi, but now they're disrespecting you as well! As you ready your weapons, the Lanius speaks once more, \"Fed fed up Lanius feed. Fed feed no fed Fed. Fed Fed, feeds.\" Now they're just outright mocking you... prepare for battle!": "",
  "Whatever, do as you please.": "",
  "You don't get paid enough to argue with the Lanius and they're barely functional translators. Frustrated, you look the other way and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "They're just doing what they have to. Leave them be.": "",
  "You'll be the last one to judge someone for scrapping the remains of fallen fleets. Though regretful, the Lanius are only doing what they have to to survive... as is the case with the Disparity, you realize. War, or no war, the two groups of Engi cannot coexist as long as the Harmony is hell-bent on the reintegration of the Separatists. Returning to reflection once more, you get ready to jump to the next beacon.": "",
  "We don't have time to mourn.": "",
  "As regretful as it is, we have our own battles to fight. We cannot allow ourselves to be swept up by our emotions while the Rebellion follows behind us, in our every footstep. There are countless people counting on you, and on your ability to remain steadfast in the face of the horrors of war. Turning away from said horrors, you begin making preparations to leave the beacon.": "",
  "With the Harmony ship defeated, the Separatists hail you once more, \"[Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!] We are ever: in -your- debt, Federation!\" After gathering themselves, they leave the beacon, and you're left feeling good about yourself.": "",
  "With the Harmony ship defeated, the Separatists hail you once more, \"[Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!] We are ever: in -your- debt, Federation!\" After gathering themselves, they leave the beacon, but not before scrounging around and finding what extra resources they can in order to repay you!": "",
  "With the Harmony ship defeated, the Separatists hail you once more, \"[Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!] We are ever: in -your- debt, Federation!\" After gathering themselves, they leave the beacon, but not before one of them shows interest in joining you and helping out other Engi the same way you helped them!": "",
  "Having dealt with the Separatist ship, the Harmony hails you, \"Federation assistance: appreciated.\" You fought a battle for them and they really decided to just repeat themselves... honestly, you could be convinced that they're just using a soundboard.": "",
  "Having dealt with the Separatist ship, the Harmony hails you, \"Federation assistance: appreciated.\" You fought a battle for them and they really decided to just repeat themselves... at the very least, they beamed over a bit of scrap as thanks. Only a bit, though...": "",
  "Having dealt with the Separatist ship, the Harmony hails you, \"Federation assistance: appreciated.\" You fought a battle for them and they really decided to just repeat themselves... though, to your surprise, they also send over an Engi to bolster your ranks! Even if they're just trying to spy on you, you appreciate all the help you can get.": "",
  "Accepting the hail, you find it's indeed the Separatists, \"Federation! We need: -help!- Harmony: [tricked] us, led us into -thinking- we were meeting with: Disparity. They desire to: [reintegrate] us...\"": "",
  "We'll deal with the Harmony.": "",
  "They jump up in joy, albeit awkwardly, \"Oh, -thank- you! -Thank- you: Federation!\" You move in on the Harmony ship, and, sensing your aggression, they turn away from the Separatists to meet you in battle!": "",
  "Sorry, but we can't help you.": "",
  "You cut communications. It's cold, but it's easier than having to see the mix of disappointment and terror on their robotic faces as you admit to leaving them to their reintegration... maybe they'll escape on their own, somehow. You can only hope so as you turn away and leave the two ships to their chase.": "",
  "Accepting the hail, you find it's indeed the Harmony, \"Federation. Separatist chase in progress. Harmony: outsped. Calculated time to chase completion: indeterminable. Harmony request: Federation assistance.\"": "",
  "We'll deal with the Separatists.": "",
  "The Engi responds, keeping it brief, \"Federation assistance: appreciated.\" You're not really sure if it's \"assistance,\" seeing that you're doing all the work... regardless, you move in on the Separatist ship, and, with you matching their pace, they turn to defend themselves!": "",
  "Sorry, but it's not our problem.": "",
  "You cut communications. Dealing with the Separatists isn't part of any of your duties, and you're not really interested in dirtying your hands with the blood of innocents right now... only right now, though.": "",
  "You're surprised to receive a hail the moment you arrive at the beacon, and you spot a Harmony ship engaging in a chase with a Separatist vessel outside. It's difficult to tell which of the two is hailing you.": "",
  "Respond to the hail.": "",
  "Ignore the hail, and the two ships.": "",
  "Pfft, like you have time to be getting involved in Engi politics. That's... why you're in an Engi sector, that happens to double as an active civil warzone. Though it's all a coincidence, really, you're just trying to reach Node 17 and end a war that the Engi also, uh, happen to be involved in. Hmm.": "",
  "They contemplate it for only a moment before speaking, \"I: suppose it -would- be [difficult] to return. I: will stay here, with you: then. He: would have -liked- that.\" The Engi moves away from the airlock, and you breathe a sigh of relief as you glance back at the book... but the writing is gone. Flipping through the rest of the book, you find that all of the pages are blank. Just what is going on?": "",
  "The Engi ignores your plea, and, unphased, they open the inner airlock and close the door behind them. Before the outer airlock is opened, though, the sound of rending metal followed by what can only be described as robotic screeching pierces your ears. Then, there is silence... until something begins banging against the door to the inner airlock. Something's breaking through, fast!": "",
  "Dropping the book, you sprint for the hold with a haste unlike any you've ever drawn upon, and, as you make it inside and lock the door behind you, you can hear the air in the previous room get jettisoned as the airlock's integrity is breached. Alarms and warning lights blare as intruders are detected, and you rush to the helm to give the command to prepare for combat. Though, when you get there...": "",
  "Look outside.": "",
  "Outside, you see... nothing. Not truly nothing, though, but something vast that embodies nothing. This nothingness completely obscures the space outside, but... you feel that you've got greater problems to worry about as you realize it's this very darkness outside that is clawing its way through your ship! You need to get out of here... but, first, prepare for combat!": "",
  "Silence is all that meets you upon arriving at the beacon. That is, until... something small bumps against the ship's hull.": "",
  "Investigate the noise.": "",
  "Scans indicate that it's an Engi, just floating in space. Vital signs read normal, meaning it must be a Disparity Elite in Hazard mode. Do you bring them aboard?": "",
  "Sure, they likely need help.": "",
  "Bringing them aboard through the airlock, you find that is indeed a Disparity Elite, but, despite floating in space for what you can only assume must have at least been days, they're in strangely good condition. Weirder yet, they're clutching onto a leather-bound book... and, before even taking a moment to relax, they speak, \"[Brother.] You're: here, just as -he- said.\" Vaguely ominous...": "",
  "He?": "",
  "The Engi nods, \"A [man.] He: arrived at our: outpost one day, among a group of -Separatist- refugees. He: -knew- you: would arrive here, -one- day. He: wanted you: to have [this.]\" They raise the book, and you get a closer look at it... unfortunately, there's very little to make note of. The book is untitled, simply leather-bound, brown, with a single latch that keeps it closed. The Engi continues, \"He: [bid] that I: -deliver- it.\"": "",
  "So you've just been... floating around in space, waiting?": "",
  "Again, they nod, \"It was his: -final- desire, as he: [died] in my: arms.\" Curious, you ask what's inside, but the Disparity Elite shakes their head, \"I: was -not- to read it. This, he: made [very] clear.\" They gesture for you to take it, and, with the book in your hands, you realize how strangely... warm it is, despite having been in the vacuum of space for so long. \"I: am to -return- now. Farewell, [brother.]\" They move to make for the inner airlock, and you glance at the book.": "",
  "Flipping through the book, you realize it appears to be empty. That is, until a few dozen pages in, where you find a single line written in red: \"Do not let them leave.\" Your gaze moves from the book back to the Engi, who has their hand on the mechanism that opens the inner airlock.": "",
  "Wait!": "",
  "The Engi pauses, and looks back, \"What -is- it?\"": "",
  "I... don't think you should leave.": "",
  "I, uh... nevermind.": "",
  "Unphased, they open the inner airlock and close the door behind them. Before the outer airlock is opened, though, the sound of rending metal followed by what can only be described as robotic screeching pierces your ears. Then, there is silence... until something begins banging against the door to the inner airlock. Something's breaking through, fast!": "",
  "Decide to read it later.": "",
  "You decide to read it later, and the Engi opens the inner airlock and closes the door behind them. Before the outer airlock is opened, though, the sound of rending metal followed by what can only be described as robotic screeching pierces your ears. Then, there is silence... until something begins banging against the door to the inner airlock. Something's breaking through, fast!": "",
  "No, I don't trust this.": "",
  "This could be some ambush for all you know. Leaving the Engi to float in space, you feel like you made the right decision as you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "It's probably fine.": "",
  "Yeah, probably. Things bump into things at extremely low speeds in space all the time, right? Or, was it extremely high speeds... regardless, you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "You defeat the Separatist ship, and the onlookers disperse. In fact, it seems like your intrusion here has caused the entirety of the war march to run for their lives... not exactly warriors, are they?": "",
  "Separatists aren't known to converge enmasse, typically choosing to live solitary lives while hiding from the Harmony... yet, being Separatists themselves, it seems the Disparity has managed to amass innumerous Separatist ships to march to war for their cause at this beacon. At your approach, one of them turns to you.": "",
  "They hail, \"[Enemy!] Federation: here! Strike, [brothers!]\" It seems the Disparity's zealotry has gotten to them... there's no talking your way out of this one. The opposing Separatist ship begins charging its weapons, and the ones nearby turn to provide support.": "",
  "They hail, \"[LIBERATOR!] Federation: here! How can we: -help,- [brothers?]\"": "",
  "Ask them what they're doing here.": "",
  "The Separatist strikes a proud pose, hands on their hips, \"We: march -against- the Harmony! No longer will we: [cower] and [hide,] but, instead, we: shall take our: -freedom- with our: own hands!\" They're really riled up...": "",
  "Indeed, we march as well, in search of our own freedom.": "",
  "\"As we: -ought- to do! When the Harmony: falls, Federation, know that we: [stand] with you: against the Rebellion. Indeed, -no- tyrant may think themselves: safe with the [LIBERATOR] on our: side!\" There's that name, again.": "",
  "Who exactly is the Liberator?": "",
  "Their pose falters, and they look at you directly, \"The [LIBERATOR:] is -nobody- in particular. We: are all our: own [LIBERATORS.] This is what it -means- to not only desire freedom, but to [fight] for it. -No- matter the cost.\"": "",
  "Who exactly were you referring to, then?": "",
  "Your question appears to trouble them, as they drop their pose completely and stare at you with an intensity unbecoming of the Separatists, \"They: do not -want- you: to know. I: may have said [too much] already...\" The Engi looks around frantically, before abruptly cutting communications. Odd they may be, you wish them well in their battles with the Harmony to come.": "",
  "Is such violence really necessary?": "",
  "Their proud pose sinks into one of solace, \"[Regrettably,] it is. The Harmony: will -not- allow us: to live our: lives in [peace.] Thus, if it's [peace] we: desire, it's [peace] we: must -fight- for.\" As unfortunate as it is, you know they're right... the situation mirrors the Federation's very own with the Rebellion.": "",
  "I thought the Separatists would be opposed to such a war.": "",
  "\"Most of us: -were.- It is the Disparity's [founder:] [HUNGER:] [LIBERATOR:] who made us: see what it is we: -had- to do.\" Roused to war, indeed... how right are the Disparity, truly?": "",
  "(The Hunger) \"SUBJECT: C-c-correct, Captain!\"": "",
  "The Hunger's presence on your ship seems to nearly send the Separatist into shock, as they fall on their back, \"[LIBERATOR!] You: -grace- us: with your: presence! [PLEASE!] Please, let us: -help- you! -Help- you: in your: -righteous- conquest!\" Word must spread quickly, because several Separatist ships turn to offer their aid. Some offer resources, some get to repairing your ship, one even offers to join... is it alright to abuse such zealotry?": "",
  "Well, I wish you all the best in your search for peace.": "",
  "Once more, the Separatist stands proud, \"And you: as well, [brother.] Send those -Rebellion- [bastards:] packing.\" Indeed, you shall. The people of this reality need you to fight for their true freedom, as the Engi need to fight for theirs.": "",
  "Ask for their assistance.": "",
  "Striking a thoughtful pose, the Separatist responds, \"What -can- we: assist you with?\"": "",
  "We could use some repairs.": "",
  "The Engi nods, \"Of course, [brother!]\" They then look to their companions, \"[Brothers!] Let us: try our best!\" They're not the greatest at it, but they do manage to patch up a few of the vulnerabilities in your hull. You thank them for their work and watch as they set off, returning to their war march... as should you return to yours.": "",
  "We could use some resources.": "",
  "The Engi nods, \"Of course, [brother!]\" They then look to their companions, \"[Brothers!] Let us: find what we: can!\" They don't have much, but they do manage to find a few bits of resources to spare regardless.

  "We could use some manpower.": "",
  "The Engi nods, \"Of course, [brother!]\" They then look to their companions, \"[Brothers!] Does anyone: wish to -assist- our Federation [brothers?]\" One of them raises their hand, and you welcome them aboard. You thank the other Separatists for their understanding and watch as they set off, returning to their war march... as should you return to yours.": "",
  "No, we're not brothers... attack!": "",
  "Cutting communications, you ready your weapons and prepare for combat. Confused, but not stupid, the Separatists move in turn to oppose you; nearby ships joining in to give supporting fire.": "",
  "Though the strange ship is defeated, the darkness remains. You've no way of knowing how many more ships are out there... it'd be best to leave as soon as you can.": "",
  "Where there should be stars, however distant, you instead find... nothing. You find the entire space around you to be enveloped in darkness.": "",
  "(The Scarred) \"Even here...\"": "",
  "The Scarred nods, \"I'll... do what I must.\" They draw upon their power, and though you still can't see out of it, just enough of the void is lifted to see an Enlightened vessel that had been hiding in the darkness. They were likely trying to lay an ambush... realizing what's occurred, they hail, \"You... how? You must be... blessed by the Dark One...\"": "",
  "Indeed, I am the Dark One's chosen.": "",
  "Instantly, they fall down in prayer, \"Oh... forgive us, Dark One! We... knew not of our sins! Oh... Dark One, please...\" Hmm... if only there were some way to convince their \"Dark One\" to forgive them...": "",
  "If you wish to be forgiven, the, uh, Dark One demands you give us tribute.": "",
  "Their face lights up, despite their lack of eyes, \"Tribute! Yes... of course! Anything for the... Dark One!\" They beam over a pile of scrap, though you feel you can get more...": "",
  "Ahem. The Dark One demands you to offer further proof of your devotion.": "",
  "\"My... devotion? Yes, of course! This... weapon was gifted to me by you, o' Dark One! Let it... be proof of my past devotion!\"": "",
  "While nice... the Dark One demands evidence of your FUTURE devotion.": "",
  "The Enlightened Cultist rises to their feet, \"Yes! My devotion! I... devote myself to you, Dark One, and your... chosen! Allow me to serve them... as I serve you!\" Moments later, they've beamed themselves over, and you've successfully tricked somebody into joining your crew! Let's just, uh, hope they never find out the truth...": "",
  "No, you're wrong. I am to be your False God's downfall.": "",
  "If the Enlightened had eyes, they'd be staring a hole straight through you, but they opt to cut communications and prepare for combat instead. Let this be the last time you have to face these fanatics in battle...": "",
  "(Deep One Cultist) \"Dodge... left.\"": "",
  "Following your Enlightened Cultist's command, you have the ship dodge to the left. They speak again, \"Right... quickly!\" You dodge once more, and this continues to go on for some time... that is, until you receive a hail from the darkness. Accepting it, you're face to face with another Enlightened Cultist, \"You... our kin stands with you. No wonder... you evade us, effortlessly. Our... apologies. Can we... make this up to you, somehow, kin?\"": "",
  "If you have any extra tribute, that'd be nice.": "",
  "\"Yes... this we can do, kin.\" Indeed, they beam over a substantial pile of scrap. Turns out having friends in dark places has its benefits... the Enlightened end communications, and you're alone in this vast nothingness once more.": "",
  "If you have any extra weapons, that'd be nice.": "",
  "\"Yes... this we can do, kin.\" Indeed, they beam over one of the weapons given to them by their Dark God. Turns out having friends in dark places has its benefits... the Enlightened end communications, and you're alone in this vast nothingness once more.": "",
  "If you have any extra manpower, that'd be nice.": "",
  "\"Yes... this we can do, kin.\" Indeed, a Deep One, but not one of the true Enlightened Cultists, beams over. Turns out having friends in dark places has its benefits... the Enlightened end communications, and you're alone in this vast nothingness once more.": "",
  "Wait, how are you and this void even here?": "",
  "The Enlightened rolls its head, as if in place of its eyes, \"The Dark One blesses these... machines. With the spreading of the Dark One's blessing... so too, does our own blessing spread. We... are bid to hunt the Dark One's enemies in this... territory, too. They may be machines, but... under the Dark One, they are kin.\" That would make the Harmony an enemy of the Dark God... interesting. \"Now... was there anything we could do for you, kin?\"": "",
  "As odd as it is, we need to leave.": "",
  "You begin getting ready to jump to the next beacon, when something crashes into your hull! It appears to be weapons-fire... indeed, while your scanners may be dulled by the darkness outside, they're still capable of picking up the faint trace of a nearby ship. They're trying to attack you under cover of darkness!": "",
  "With the Disparity ship defeated, all is silent once more. Silence... embrace it, and it shall embrace you in turn.": "",
  "The integrity of their ship diminishing rapidly, the Disparity frantically hails you, \"Wait, come on! Can I, like, bribe you somehow? Maybe, like, send a drone, or give one of your Separatists some: power?\" Oddly spoken, especially for an Engi with their life on the line...": "",
  "(Engi Separatist) Sure, power sounds cool.": "",
  "The Disparity Elite plays a sigh sound effect, out loud, in relief, \"Phew, awesome. Thanks, Fed, just send 'em: over.\" You do as you're told and send your Separatist to the other vessel, but they pause communications while they do whatever it is that they're doing. You were a little curious as to the process...": "",
  "Wait for your Engi's return.": "",
  "You're left waiting a lot longer than you expected... though, eventually, your Separatist does indeed return. Transformed into a Disparity Elite, no less... they seem a little out of it, so you move to help them sit down, but you're sent reeling in pain when you try grabbing their arm. For whatever reason, they are extremely hot to the touch. You surmise that it's likely something to do with whatever process was involved in the transformation, but... you're only left feeling more curious than when you started while you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "(Nano Separatist) Sure, power sounds cool.": "",
  "Yeah, a drone sounds cool, I guess.": "",
  "The Disparity Elite plays a sigh sound effect, out loud, in relief, \"Phew, awesome. Thanks, Fed, I'll send it: over.\" You're not left waiting long, as some cargo appears in your hold only a few moments later. Inspecting it, you find it to indeed be a Disparity drone... though, later, as you go to leave the beacon, you think about how oddly warm to the touch it was.": "",
  "Nah, I Just want to kill you.": "",
  "A lone Disparity ship awaits you at this beacon. At least, they appear to be alone... they often aren't, but they also aren't immediately engaging you.": "",
  "Try hailing them.": "",
  "To your surprise, they accept, and you're met with the visage of a Disparity Elite leaned back in their chair, \"Hey, Fed guy. Something: up?\" Strangely casual for an Engi.": "",
  "Was just wondering what you were up to.": "",
  "The Disparity Elite plays a sigh sound effect, out loud, \"Higher-ups put me on beacon patrol. On the lookout for threats, or: whatever.\"": "",
  "Am I not a threat?": "",
  "They sit up in their chair slightly, \"Are: you?\" A fair question, you suppose...": "",
  "No, I guess not.": "",
  "\"Yeah, I didn't think: so.\" They go back to leaning back all the way, before continuing, \"Say, I've been wondering something. What's the deal with: oxygen?\"": "",
  "Is this, like, an airplane food joke?": "",
  "Again, they sit up, this time leaning forward and looking you in the face for the first time, \"No, I'm serious. Why do Engi even need to breathe? Like, and then, when we're destabilized, we don't need to, meaning that only Separatists don't need to breathe, but only sometimes. Then the Liberator grants me higher power and a grander form and I, like, still need to breathe the majority of the time... but not in Hazard mode, when I'm yellow. What's up with: that?\"": "",
  "Wait, the Liberator? A higher power?": "",
  "They lean back, \"Shit. I said too much, again... this always happens when I ramble to random strangers. Can you forget I said anything? For my sake? Big guy wouldn't like it if word got out that I was yapping about the Disparity's secrets: again...\"": "",
  "Big guy?": "",
  "\"Yeah, the H-\" they pause, \"Damn, I nearly did it again. Listen, can I give you a drone and have you be quiet, or something? Maybe share some power with one of your Separatists, if you have: any?\"": "",
  "The Disparity Elite plays another sigh sound effect, this one lighter, \"Phew, awesome. Thanks, Fed, just send 'em: over.\" You do as you're told and send your Separatist to the other vessel, but they pause communications while they do whatever it is that they're doing. You were a little curious as to the process...": "",
  "The Disparity Elite plays another sigh sound effect, this one lighter, \"Phew, awesome. Thanks, Fed, I'll send it: over.\" You're not left waiting long, as some cargo appears in your hold only a few moments later. Inspecting it, you find it to indeed be a Disparity drone... though, later, as you go to leave the beacon, you think about how oddly warm to the touch it was.": "",
  "You can't buy my silence!": "",
  "The Engi plays a laugh track, \"Guess I'm just gonna have to, like, kill you then, man. Sorry about: this.\" Their weapons spring to life!": "",
  "Yeah, I am!": "",
  "Yeah! You can help me by DYING!": "",
  "The Engi plays a laugh track, out loud, \"Guess I'm just gonna have to, like, kill you then, man. Sorry about: this.\" Their weapons spring to life!": "",
  "They're alone? Attack!": "",
  "You move in on the Disparity ship, making your aggression known, and they begin charging their weapons in self-defense.": "",
  "Cool, there's a ship... do you know how many ships you see, traveling through countless sectors? Like you need to be interested in each and every one. Thus, ignoring the ship, you make preparations to leave the beacon.": "",
  "You manage to break free from the darkness, but you're not safe yet. You need to get out of here!": "",
  "The darkness rips and tears at your hull, but you're able to free yourself from its grasp before you sustain truly heavy damage. Still, you need to get out of here while you still have the chance!": "",
  "Before you can move to do anything, you receive a hail. Not from any nearby ship, though, but an outpost on the surface of a nearby moon... weirder yet, it's on a Free Mantis channel.": "",
  "You accept the hail, but there's no visual feed. Still, though staticky and muffled, a voice breaks through, \"Fed-------- --tting out of t----- Sha---- --uff comi--- --adows s----- -o get here! Get he---\" The feed dies. It sounded urgent, like they were trying to warn you... and the last words you understood bid you reach them. Should you make for the outpost?": "",
  "Suddenly, I don't feel safe... make for the outpost.": "",
  "This moon is extremely cold, it being completely frozen over, though you're still capable of scanning and finding the outpost on its surface. Stepping out into the piercing cold, with your feet sinking into the snow, you realize there's no activity within. The place, one giant building, looks abandoned, and you're second-guessing entering when you look up and notice the stars... extinguishing? No, being blotted out... something vast is blanketing the moon, and fast! You need to get inside now!": "",
  "As darkness descends upon the moon, you rush for the only door to the building that you can see. Frozen shut and operated by a valve, it takes all your strength to manage to force the door open and throw yourself inside. Closing the door, you scan the room you're in and find that it's... strangely warm, its confines vaguely illuminated by faint, red lights along the walls. You're unsure how long you'll have to be here, so you may as well get settled in...": "",
  "Explore the facility.": "",
  "Your footsteps echo throughout this strange place's halls, the only sounds that accompany the heavy snowfall that can be faintly heard outside. That is, until you get deeper, and you hear... a voice. It's distant, and you can't make it out, but it never seems to stop talking.": "",
  "Go towards the voice.": "",
  "Ignoring your better judgment, you approach the voice. As you get closer, you begin to make it out, \"Federation! Getting out of there! Shadows stuff coming! Shadows stuff, no get here! Get here!\" Then, a few seconds later, \"Federation! Getting out of there! Shadows stuff coming! Shadows stuff, no get here! Get here!\" It's looping, over and over again. You recognize it as the same call you received on the ship... reaching the voice's source, you find nobody in the room, merely some comms gear against the wall.": "",
  "What the hell is this?": "",
  "A thick layer of dust coats the entirety of the room. There's no telling just how long this recording has been looping, but it accurately predicted both your arrival and the shadows' approach... something unnatural is at work here, and you've done exactly as its asked. Perhaps something awaits you further within...": "",
  "Venture deeper into the facility.": "",
  "The deeper you go, the warmer it seems to get... and, eventually, you realize you can't hear the snowfall outside anymore. Not that that's really a concern, though, as it seems to have been replaced by a distant droning much further into the tunnel. A droning that's... quickly approaching.": "",
  "Stay stalwart. Approach the droning.": "",
  "You keep moving, and you realize its not droning but... more of a rushing sound, akin to a wave. That's when a roiling mass of what can only be described as liquid shadow overtakes you, and, instantly, you lose your footing and any sense of direction. As you suffocate, you don't feel panicked, but merely adrift... like falling into a deep sleep... in a loved one's embrace...": "",
  "Drown.": "",
  "Yes, you drown... or, at least, you should've. Though, clearly, you don't... odd.": "",
  "Can you? Are you not trapped here, against your will?": "",
  "You try to drown, you really do. You choke yourself, you punch your lungs, you take in deep breaths of shadow-stuff. Alas, you cannot. I'd... like to ask you something. Is it your desire to die here? Or, is it simply to have this nightmare end?": "",
  "I want to die.": "",
  "Yet, you don't. Why is that?": "",
  "They won't let me.": "",
  "Who? Who won't let you?": "",
  "The one who pulls my strings. They pull, and pull, and pull, and pull, and pull, and pull, and pull...": "",
  "I want this to end.": "",
  "I'm sorry, then. I'll try to make this quick.": "",
  "It hurts...": "",
  "A voice speaks to you from the shadows that surround you, \"TRULY, I AM SORRY.\"": "",
  "Please... it hurts so much...": "",
  "No, this isn't right. Turn back.": "",
  "Though you're overcome with fear, you realize you've likely waited too long to turn back... you run with all the swiftness that you can, but the droning only gets louder behind you. That's when you recognize that it's not droning, but moreso rushing... you're mid-thought when a roiling mass of what can only be described as liquid shadow overtakes you, and, instantly, you lose your footing and any sense of direction. As you suffocate, you don't feel panicked, but merely adrift... like falling into a deep sleep... in a loved one's embrace...": "",
  "Something is wrong. Turn back.": "",
  "Turning back, your walk turns into a pace and then further into a full-on sprint as panic sets in. Something led you here. It WANTS you here. You need to get out of here... you'd sooner take the shadows, if you had to. Yes, the shadows... when you get back, you'll swing that door open and leave this wretched place, shadows be damned!": "",
  "Keep sprinting.": "",
  "To your relief, you do eventually manage to return to the exit. Without any hesitation, you swing open the door, and...": "",
  "It's... beautiful...": "",
  "Indeed, it is, and you are devoured by it.": "",
  "Nope, screw that. Turn back.": "",
  "It doesn't take long to return to the room from which you started. Suppose there's nothing else to do but wait...": "",
  "Wait out the storm.": "",
  "You don't trust this place at all. Who knows what the hell's in here? You're vaguely certain that it's a Free Mantis that called you here, but, besides that, there's absolutely zero telling what lurks deeper within these dimly lit corridors. It's much safer to simply... wait this out.": "",
  "I'm... sure we're fine. Remain here.": "",
  "This could be a trap, for all you know... and, if anything does indeed happen, it's your ship where you feel safest. As you think on that, though, a darkness descends outside...": "",
  "Maybe whoever was warning you had the right idea. The stars are blotted out, one by one, as you're engulfed in total darkness... as bad as that is, though, it's moreso the loud banging on the hull that you're worried about.": "",
  "We need to get out of here, now!": "",
  "You try to move the ship, but something in the darkness appears to be holding it in place... or, it IS the darkness holding it in place. You're either going to need to jump straight out of here, or combat this shadowy menace head-on. As you move to give the combat command, several intruders are detected... it seems that some of the darkness has managed to get inside!": "",
  "You wake up, face-down in the snow. You're outside... and the stars are here, too. It's over... and you're fine, it all must have been a dream. You must have hit your head as you rushed into the facility... this must have all been over nothing. A false alarm... one that's wasted an immense amount of time.": "",
  "I need to get back to the ship...": "",
  "Back inside the ship, you're shocked to see none other than... a Free Mantis. They really had been calling. \"Ohhh, Federation, Federation! You goods, yes? Brought goods, please get goods-er!\" With a claw, they gesture to something they must have brought with them. It's... a weapon, one of pure darkness. Where did they get this? \"Hmm? Oh, founds it in scary place. Figured Federation enjoys such gifts, hopes to make proud.\" You have so many questions... but, maybe they're better left unanswered.": "",
  "Back inside the ship, you're shocked to see none other than... a Free Mantis. They really had been calling. \"Ohhh, Federation, Federation! You goods, yes? Brought goods, please get goods-er!\" With a claw, they gesture to something they must have brought with them. It's... a drone, one of pure darkness. Where did they get this? \"Hmm? Oh, founds it in scary place. Figured Federation enjoys such gifts, hopes to make proud.\" You have so many questions... but, maybe they're better left unanswered.": "",
  "So, you wait. Then, you... wait some more. It's after a moderate to large amount of waiting that you hear a pitter-patter down the corridor... you recognize the sound to be Mantis footsteps, but the best you can do is merely hope that they're Free Mantis ones...": "",
  "Hope...": "",
  "They arrive, and you're relieved to find that it is indeed a Free Mantis, \"Oh! You heres, sorry for not comings sooner... was busy sendings out warning. Outside safe now, though! Shadows gone!\" They gesture to open the door, and, trusting your newfound friend, you open it... indeed, the stars have returned. You breathe a sigh of relief as you return to the ship with the Free Mantis in tow. Seems they intend to join you, and you're more than ready to get the hell out of here.": "",
  "This beacon appears to be empty. Unfortunate, but it means that you have some time on your hands while the FTL drive charges.": "",
  "You think you're alone for a moment when a glimmer outside catches your eye... it's a Disparity ship, charging at you!": "",
  "In a war as bloody as this one, the Disparity must believe it's best to generally blast first and ask questions later. Without even a thought as to your allegiance, one of their ships comes at you, weapons ready!": "",
  "The Disparity appears to have control over this beacon... untrusting, the guard assigned to its protection prepares for an assault!": "",
  "Pink, shimmering and... strangely mesmerizing, you're able to easily spot the Disparity ship guarding this beacon. Unfortunately, they can also easily spot you, and they decide you might be a threat!": "",
  "The Harmony appears to still have control over this beacon... desperate to keep it that way, the guard here assumes you're a threat and prepares to attack!": "",
  "Likely assigned to scout the beacon for signs of Disparity intrusion, a Harmony ship is roaming outside. Upon noticing your arrival, they move in to defend the territory.": "",
  "Chaos is unfolding at this beacon... it's a bloodbath between the Harmony and Disparity! Caught in the crossfire, one of the nearby ships decides you're an immediate threat!": "",
  "You narrowly dodge a volley of weapons-fire as you enter the beacon, and you realize you've jumped directly into an active warzone! A ship notices your arrival and breaks off from their fleet to begin its assault.": "",
  "If they're going to slaughter each other at these beacons, can't they at least, like, announce it? Mark the beacon as being an active death sentence or something? What if you were a civilian, just trying to move around, and you happened to jump straight into a giant barrage of weapons-fire? As you ponder these safety concerns, one of the ships nearby decides you're its new target!": "",
  "Not exactly a sight you want to see. The two fleets are warring with each other, with complete disregard for anyone happening to pass by through... or, so you think, as a ship moves in to regard you as a threat!": "",
  "You feel judged as you prepare to return to battle.": "",
  "The Disparity hails, desperately, \"Maybe we: -can- be [brothers,] yet?\" Strange way of begging for forgiveness...": "",
  "Cracks form in the Disparity's crystalline hull. This seems to concern them, as they offer to surrender.": "",
  "With their ship on the brink of destruction, the Disparity hails you, \"You: have -bested- us. Show: [mercy,] and be forgiven.\" Didn't they attack you...?": "",
  "Apparently, even the Disparity can value their lives over their convictions. They're begging that you let them live.": "",
  "Something appears to be leaking from the pink crystal that encases the Disparity's ship. Desperate to avoid the situation getting any worse, they hail and ask you to let them go. Would they let you go, were the tables turned?": "",
  "You're hailed by the enemy, \"You -have- proved: your [point.] You -have- bested: [us.] You -have- forgiveness: in your [heart.]\" Do you?": "",
  "Your scanners are picking up FTL signatures, the Disparity are trying to escape!": "",
  "A chain reaction occurs on the Disparity ship, and their crystalline hull is splintered from the inside... you watch as the shadows break in and devour everything they can. What they can't, is yours.": "",
  "Though you're not desperate to stick around, you can't help but admire the sheen on what was once the Disparity's hull... now, it's just some shards of crystal floating in space.": "",
  "While not particularly safe, you make sure to scrap what you can before leaving. As you do so, you wonder if things really had to end this way.": "",
  "Shadows break forth as the Disparity's hull is shattered, and you do your best to dodge them, but... what are they, exactly?": "",
  "In an act of futility, the Disparity attempt to make an evasive maneuver. As they do so, the front-end of their hull shatters, resulting in the ship being shrouded in darkness. As it dissipates, you see holes torn into everything... though, plenty of valuables still remain.": "",
  "The crystals encasing the Disparity's ship actually appear to be relatively undamaged... though, the murky darkness that appears to lurk within makes you uncomfortable as you do your best to scrap around them.": "",
  "While aboard the Disparity ship, you feel uneasy. Though you can't explain it, it's best to leave as soon as you can, you think.": "",
  "Nothing appears to remain of the Disparity Elites' bodies. You're here for their loot, not their corpses, but you still can't help but wonder what happened to them.": "",
  "Even though you're in hostile territory, you can't help but do a quick search of the Disparity ship... you may as well get what you can out of this.": "",
  "You're in the middle of recovering what loot you can from the Disparity ship when you hear a banging against the inside of the hull. Something's breaking in from the outside... or, merely the middle? Regardless, you grab what you can and leave as soon as possible.": "",
  "One of the doors on the Disparity ship has been sealed shut. Peeking in through a window, you can't see anything... only blackness. You decide it's best to leave the room alone and find valuables elsewhere on the ship.": "",
  "The insides of a Disparity ship certainly aren't as lustrous as their crystalline outsides... still, they have a certain way with decoration. You remark on how it was this freedom to decorate, among other freedoms, that led to their lives being cut short.": "",
  "The Harmony pauses the battle to hail you, \"Hull integrity: critical. Request: cease Federation assault.\" This is a Harmony assault on you! The nerve...": "",
  "The Engi's strange way of ship construction appears to be failing them, as bits and pieces slough off. Realizing this, they request a ceasefire.": "",
  "It's not common for the Harmony to admit their mistakes, but they do so now, and surrender... even if it's only in the name of self-preservation.": "",
  "Your scanners are picking up FTL signatures, the Harmony are trying to escape!": "",
  "The Harmony ship breaks apart, and nanites flow out in every direction... you wonder how the Harmony goes about reclaiming them all, if they even try.": "",
  "With one last strike, the ship is blown apart. The Disparity must be proud of you, and the way you fight for what you believe in... scrap!": "",
  "Engi architecture is so strange in its asymmetrical uniformity. Why not just have it be completely uniform? Or, why not go all out and make everything asymmetrical? These are the things you ponder as you step over the lifeless remains of the Engi and collect what you can from their ship.": "",
  "As you loot the ship, part of you wonders why the Engi were built to be so incapable of defending themselves. You know they have their drones, but still.": "",
  "Even though you're in hostile territory, you can't help but do a quick search of the Harmony ship... you may as well get what you can out of this.": "",
  "Wait! We're allies!": "",
  "They didn't recognize you for a second there! The ship stands down, and you're free to do something on the ship while you prepare to leave.": "",
  "They didn't recognize you for a second there! The ship stands down, but incoming fire is still flying from both directions! You need to get out of here!": "",
  "You spend a fair amount of time scavenging amongst the debris, but you don't find much. A shame, but at least it's better than nothing... maybe you should keep going?": "",
  "Your instincts tells you that there's something of value still here... and, indeed, after another fair bit of searching, you find something! Amidst the remains of a Disparity ship, what appeared to be naught but torn metal and thousands of fine crystalline shards, lies one of their strange drones. It's in perfect condition... you suppose it's yours, now.": "",
  "That's enough searching. I'm ready to leave.": "",
  "Perhaps you've spent enough time here, if not too much already. You prepare to leave the beacon, content.": "",
  "You spend a fair amount of time scavenging amongst the debris, and you manage to find an equally fair amount of loot. It could be more, but... yeah, maybe you should keep going?": "",
  "You spend a fair amount of time scavenging amongst the debris, and it's well worth it! You manage to find a large amount of loot, but... maybe you should keep going?": "",
  "You spend a fair amount of time scavenging amongst the debris, and you find the motherlode: a Disparity drone in perfect condition, as well as a large variety of other loot! Content that you've collected everything of value, you prepare to leave the beacon with your newfound hoard.": "",
  "A battle appears to have recently been fought here, judging by the debris floating around. If you'd like, you could spend some time scavenging around and see if there's anything of value left.": "",
  "Scavenge the area.": "",
  "Deciding to leave the debris alone, you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "You can't explain it, but a chill runs down your spine as you enter the beacon. You feel pulled to your hold...": "",
  "Investigate the hold.": "",
  "Inside, you find... random stuff, that wasn't there before. You're not sure how it got here, but... free stuff is free stuff, you guess.": "",
  "Opening the container, you find... fuel. Suppose that was somewhat expected. You're not sure of this Fuelmonger's identity, but you appreciate their patronage.": "",
  "Opening the container, a Disparity Elite bursts forth... how long have they been in there? Hastily, they speak, \"I: AM THE [FUELMONGER!] YOU: HAVE -FALLEN- FOR MY: TRAP, AND I: AM -HERE- FOR YOUR FUEL!\" You didn't realize there were rogue Disparity Elites working as fuel-thieving bandits...": "",
  "Over my dead body!": "",
  "The Fuelmonger cackles, \"[INDEED!]\"": "",
  "Sure, take some, you weirdo... [-3{]": "",
  "As you hand over the fuel, the Fuelmonger's stomach shifts and forms a sort of vacuum: they consume the fuel cells whole. After their stomach closes back up, they speak, \"YES! -YES!- I: AM THE [FUELMONGER,] AND YOU: ARE MY: [SUBJECT!] LET US: -PILLAGE- AND -DEVOUR- ALL THE FUEL IN THIS [PITIFUL] MULTIVERSE.\" They walk off, and you're certain you're not going to give them any more fuel, but... sure. They can stick around if they want.": "",
  "Fuelmonger": "",
  "There's nothing here. At least, you didn't realize there was something here at first. Floating in space is a small container labeled: \"FOR YOU. WISHING YOU THE BEST, FUELMONGER.\" Fuelmonger? You're not sure if you like the sound of that...": "",
  "Bring the container aboard, and open it.": "",
  "Leave it. There's no telling what this dastardly Fuelmonger may be up to.": "",
  "Though, you feel the name may be so on the nose as to loop back around to being trustworthy... still, you trust your intuition and prepare to jump.": "",
  "As you jump into the beacon, you nearly collide with a Disparity ship... no, a wreck. It appears to have long been abandoned.": "",
  "Free scrap!": "",
  "You're right up against the ship, ready to scrap it, when a Ghost phases through the wall. They speak in a polite tone, \"Doth thou mind? Thou art intruding on mine... personal space.\" Seems not even Disparity wrecks are free from Ghost habitation.": "",
  "(Ghost Crew) \"Well met, good felow!\"": "",
  "The Ghost turns to yours, \"Hail! I'd failed to see thee there.\" The two hit it off, and the conversation eventually turns to the topic of housing. Your Ghost speaks, \"Oh, mine captain's ship is most lovely. Save for the tremendously common raids from foul brigands and the like, it's practically a paradise!\" This seems to get the other Ghost thinking, \"Mine abode is most... troubling. Every night, this damnable banging can be heard, I swear it to be demons trying to break in!\" Without even asking you, your Ghost offers to allow the other to switch housings and be his roommate... and they accept! Maybe you should try being all courteous and fancy sometime.": "",
  "Yeah, sorry. I'll back off.": "",
  "A hint of glee coats the Ghost's voice, \"Thou art most kind. Yes, I bid thee and thy crew farewell.\" They phase back through the wall, and you're left feeling a little awkward.": "",
  "No! This is my wreck now!": "",
  "Scorn now coats the Ghost's voice, \"Truly? Then know mine wrath; en garde!\" While you're combatting the Ghost, the other Ghosts onboard the wreck make a getaway with it... a shame.": "",
  "The darkness rips and tears at your hull, but you're able to free yourself from its grasp before you sustain truly heavy damage. In the meantime, you've lost sight of the Separatist ship within the shroud... you can only pray they made it out, but you still need to get out yourself!": "",
  "You successfully force the darkness to reel, but... you lost sight of the Separatist ship during the fight. You can only pray they made it out, but you still need to get out yourself!": "",
  "You successfully force the darkness to reel, and, in a hurry, the Separatist ship hails you, \"-Thank- you, oh: -thank- you... this [nightmare] just -appeared- out of: thin air!\" They quickly send you a gift for your troubles before leaving the system, and you've ought to do the same!": "",
  "You successfully force the darkness to reel, but you realize the Separatists are having trouble with their engines... they're sitting ducks! Heroically, you dock your ship against theirs and allow the survivors to evacuate...": "",
  "Wait for the survivors.": "",
  "...but only two Engi board, and you recall that Separatists are typically found in low numbers. Now relatively safe, the Engi thank you for saving their lives and swear to help however they can... but you still need to get out of here!": "",
  "You find yourself enshrouded in a strange darkness at this beacon. After a moment of searching, you spot where the distress signal is coming from: a Separatist vessel, being assaulted by massive, shadowy tendrils! You could likely get out of here unscathed if you left them be, as bait... nobody would know.": "",
  "No, I won't! Fire upon the tendrils.": "",
  "Drawing the tendrils' ire, they pull away from the Separatist ship and reenter the amorphous cloud of darkness you find yourself surrounded by... then, they strike from beneath you! Get ready!": "",
  "Leave the Separatists to their fate.": "",
  "Your life comes first, and you're not really in the mood to be brawling with massive hell-clouds. Leaving the Separatists behind, you prepare to hightail it out of here!": "",
  "You hail, and hail, and hail, and... eventually, somebody picks up! Disgruntled, a very hastily-dressed man answers, \"Hey, yeah, sorry... we're both asleep at this hour. Appreciate your, eh, persistence though... we've been stranded here for a few days, after a run-in with the... Disparity.\" His face sours as he says the name, but then he continues, \"Could you spare us some fuel? We can, uh... pay.\"": "",
  "Trade them some fuel. [-5{]": "",
  "Sending the fuel over, they send some scrap in return. The man thanks you, and the Federation vessel leaves the beacon. All in a day's work for a Multiverse-travelling, life-saving, fuel-donating Renegade such as yourself!": "",
  "Hey, the Disparity are my friends! If you've got a problem with them, you've got a problem with me!": "",
  "The man raises his eyebrow and sighs, \"Look, man... we're Federation. I know you're a Renegade, but we can't just be pissing off the Harmony.\" He turns away, putting his hand to his temple, \"We're swamped by the Rebellion as it is... we need all the allies we can get.\"": "",
  "Yeah, and I choose to ally with the Disparity. They believe in something we all ought to... freedom, for everybody.": "",
  "He turns back to face you, perplexion on his face, \"Yeah, I suppose that is a possibility, isn't it? A better reality, for everyone...\" he thinks it over for a moment, before speaking once more, \"...screw it. I wanna believe in whatever shit you're smoking; count us in.\" He runs into another room, \"Yea-hah! We're Renegades now, baby!\" After a period of time, him and his crewmate come over, carrying all sorts of goodies!": "",
  "He rolls his eyes, \"And why'd you wake me up, then?\" Communications are cut, and you're left feeling rather awkward... hey, at least you tried.": "",
  "You hail, and hail, and hail, but... nobody ever responds. You're wondering if you should go and investigate, when... the ship explodes, and a cloud of darkness envelops your ship! Was it just a trap, or had something terrible happened to that Federation ship...? You may never know. What you do know is that, right now, you need to prepare for combat!": "",
  "If it isn't a sight for sore eyes... the distress call is coming from a fellow Federation vessel! They don't hail at your approach, though. In fact, they don't appear to be doing much of anything.": "",
  "There's no response.": "",
  "Hail, again.": "",
  "Again, there's no response.": "",
  "Keep hailing.": "",
  "This is too creepy... prepare to get out of here.": "",
  "Suspecting that something is very wrong, you'd rather not take your chances. You leave the Federation ship alone as you prepare to leave the beacon, and it merely floats there the entire time.": "",
  "How rude! If they don't want to talk to me, then I don't want to talk to them!": "",
  "Yeah, tell 'em! If they're in distress, the least they could do is hail you first! Content in leaving these impertinent half-wits to their fate, you keep to yourself as the FTL drive charges.": "",
  "Searching for the source of the distress call, you spot an Engi Defender just... floating in space, encased in its defensive bubble. They won't last long out there!": "",
  "Get them onboard!": "",
  "With haste, you maneuver to pick them up... but, once they're onboard, you realize that their vitals are critical. Do you have any way to save them?": "",
  "(Upg. Medbay) Bring the Defender to the Medbay!": "",
  "You put the Defender in your Medbay, and pray that they'll be okay... indeed, after some time passes, they're back on their feet! \"Federation assistance: appreciated. Result of Disparity assault: destruction of former Harmony ship. New directive: assist Federation ship.\" Looks like your heroics have earned you a new ally!": "",
  "(Upg. Clonebay) Bring the Defender to the Clonebay!": "",
  "After allowing the Defender to die, you use your Clonebay to bring them back, and... indeed, after some time passes, they're back on their feet! \"Federation assistance: appreciated.

  "(Disparity Elite) Have your Disparity Elite place down a Hazard beacon to heal them.": "",
  "Your Disparity Elite does as you say, and places down a Hazard beacon... and, indeed, after some time passes, the Defender is back on their feet! Though, they take an aggressive stance as they speak, \"Federation: harboring Disparity fugitives. Harmony protocol: extermination of Federation traitors.\" Even though you saved them, they're attacking!": "",
  "As unfortunate as it is, you have no means of saving the Defender. They die, and you're left feeling somewhat defeated as you jump to the next beacon.": "",
  "With haste, you maneuver to pick them up... but, once they're onboard, they turn their weapons against you! Seems they're not stoked on the whole helping-out-the-Disparity thing...": "",
  "Leave them to die.": "",
  "You leave the Defender floating in space, and you watch as their defensive bubble fails them and the vacuum of space claims another victim... somewhat morbid, but, hey! Just doing what you have to do, right?": "",
  "Now that they're no longer under assault, the Harmony outpost hails you, \"Harmony: appreciative of Federation support. Directive: send Harmony support in return.\" An Engi is sent to support you! They've also likely been sent to spy on you, but, you can overlook that part.": "",
  "Jumping into the beacon, you analyze the situation: a Harmony outpost is under attack by a Disparity ship!": "",
  "Defend the outpost!": "",
  "Moving in-between the ship and the outpost, you make your intentions known... and the Disparity switches targets!": "",
  "Cheer the Disparity on!": "",
  "You hail the Disparity, cheering them on, and one of the Disparity Elites makes a big, floating thumbs up with its nanites. You know they've got this! While they get this, though, you're busy preparing to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Ignore the ongoing fight.": "",
  "Whichever side wins, you're just not in the mood to intervene. You leave the two sides to their fighting and wait as the FTL drive charges.": "",
  "As you're salvaging, your ship receives a transmission... from the Harmony Elite! It's the Harmony Link coordinate fragment... suppose you've at least proved yourself, even if you haven't gained their full trust. With their commander defeated, the Disparity assault disperses, and the remnants of the Harmony fleet follow to eliminate any stragglers. With that, you're left alone with the coordinate fragment...": "",
  "As celebratory as your victory here was, you still have fragments to collect. You must push on.": "",
  "This is it. You have all three coordinate fragments... inputting them together, your map is updated with one final location: the Harmony Link. The fate of this sector... no, the fate of each and every Engi... it all rests on this.": "",
  "As you're salvaging, you find what you're looking for... the Harmony Link coordinate fragment, secure within a case! Meanwhile, as the Harmony loses it commander, all Engi are directed to retreat... you've won!": "",
  "Hail the Disparity commander.": "",
  "Somewhat cautiously, the commander speaks, \"Though: we -hesitate- to call you our [brother...] you have done us a -great- service in this battle. You: may -even- know [LIBERATION] yet...\" Their work complete, the Disparity fleet disperses... and you're left with the Harmony Link coordinate fragment.": "",
  "The commander is already mid-celebration as you hail, \"[Brothers!] We: are -victorious!- You: are -victorious!- Our: people will -tell- [tales] of this battle for -years- to come!\" Their work complete, the Disparity fleet disperses... and you're left with the Harmony Link coordinate fragment.": "",
  "You've arrived at the set of coordinates labeled \"BATTLEFIELD.\" Apparently, one of the Harmony Link coordinate fragments is here...": "",
  "Analyze the scene.": "",
  "Unsurprisingly, this is indeed a battlefield: the Harmony and Disparity are locked in a massive conflict, and you notice an Elite heading the Harmony fleet. If anybody's got the fragment, it's them. Upon noticing your arrival, this Elite hails you, \"Federation arrival: fortunate. Disparity assault: gaining ground. Disparity priority target: commander of Disparity assault.\" They point you to the ship in question, and it's a large vessel at the head of the assault, \"Harmony auxiliary force: standing ground. Federation directive: elimination of Disparity assault commander. Likelihood of Disparity dispersal in the event of Disparity assault commander's elimination: 99%.\"": "",
  "Alright, I'll handle it. Make for the Disparity commander.": "",
  "You move to begin your assault on the Disparity commander, and, though you've got covering fire, they do as well... get ready!": "",
  "Sorry, commander, but... I'm turning coats. Attack the Harmony Elite!": "",
  "They seem dumbfounded by this, \"Federation action: illogical. Likelihood of Harmony victory... diminishing. New priority target: Federation Renegade.\" They cut communications, and though the Harmony fleet turns to provide covering fire... so does the Disparity fleet! You're not alone in this!": "",
  "Unsurprisingly, this is indeed a battlefield: the Harmony and Disparity are locked in a massive conflict, and you notice an Elite heading the Harmony fleet. If anybody's got the fragment, it's them. Upon noticing your arrival, the Disparity commander hails you, \"[Brothers!] We: are -pushing- them back! Though: a priority target -still- remains... the: [Elite] heading the Harmony fleet -possesses- the coordinate fragment we're -hunting- for. Could: you -handle- it, [brothers?]\"": "",
  "Alright, I'll handle it. Make for the Harmony Elite.": "",
  "You move to begin your assault on the Harmony Elite, and, though you've got covering fire, they do as well... get ready!": "",
  "Sorry, commander, but... I'm turning coats. Attack the Disparity commander!": "",
  "They're taken aback by this, \"To: think I -thought- us [brothers...] so: be it! Bring: it on, and -know- the -wrath- of those who -fight- for [LIBERATION!]\" They cut communications, and though the Disparity fleet turns to provide covering fire... so does the Harmony fleet! You're not alone in this!": "",
  "Now that you've saved them from the Disparity, the Harmony has little choice but to trust you... if they can't defeat the Disparity, you clearly can. They send you a copy of the Harmony Link coordinate fragment.": "",
  "You've arrived at the set of coordinates labeled \"CACHE.\" Apparently, one of the Harmony Link coordinate fragments is here...": "",
  "At this beacon is a Harmony outpost, under attack by a Disparity ship. If the cache is anywhere, it's aboard the outpost... to your surprise, the Disparity hails you, \"Look whose [dog] just -showed- up on a: leash... if it isn't the: [Federation.] -You- may obey the Harmony, but that -doesn't- mean we: will. We're -finding- the Harmony Link, and [LIBERATING] our kind: -once- and for all... and if you want to -stop- us, then you'll have to [kill] -me- to do: it.\"": "",
  "Then kill you I shall.": "",
  "They let out a robotic laugh, \"A -loyal- [mutt] until the: end... [DIE.]\" They turn away from the outpost, prepared to take you on!": "",
  "You've got it wrong. I'm loyal to nobody, and certainly not to the Harmony.": "",
  "This gets them to lean forward a bit, \"[Really?] So you -won't- mind if we: just... -kill- them, and take the: cache?\" You nod your head, and they seem intrigued, \"-You- may be more -free- than any of us: Renegade. I [like] your: style.\"": "",
  "They return to sieging the outpost, and you watch as they claim both victory and the cache. Afterwards, they hail once more, \"I -know- what you're here for: and I'd be [lying] if I said I didn't -appreciate- your willingness to: [cooperate.] We could use your -help- yet: Renegade.\" As they leave the beacon, they send you a copy of the Harmony Link coordinate fragment, and you're left alone...": "",
  "As convenient as this was, you still have fragments to collect. You must push on.": "",
  "At this beacon is a Harmony outpost, under attack by a Disparity ship. If the cache is anywhere, it's aboard the outpost... as you approach, the Disparity hails, \"Welcome: [brothers!] You're here -just- in time. The [coordinate fragment] is -about- to be in our hands: as -soon- as we take this: outpost.\"": "",
  "You've got this!": "",
  "Indeed, they do! They return to sieging the outpost, and you watch as they claim both victory and the cache.": "",
  "Afterwards, they hail once more, \"We hope you -enjoyed- the show: [brother.] May we both soon -enjoy- the true reward: [LIBERATION!] At -long:- last...\" They send you a copy of the Harmony Link coordinate fragment as they leave the beacon, and you're left alone.": "",
  "I'm sorry, but... I can't let you do that.": "",
  "The excitement that was just in their voice vanishes, \"Truly: [brother?] Should I: even -call- you: that? I can only -hope- that you're doing what you believe is -best- for: you.\" With little solace in their heart, they turn away from the outpost to face you head on.": "",
  "You've arrived at the set of coordinates labeled \"AMBUSH.\" Apparently, one of the Harmony Link coordinate fragments is here...": "",
  "The scene is... a gruesome one. The victim of the ambush was a Disparity ship, but it took out several Harmony ships with it. You don't see any survivors... if the Harmony Link coordinate fragment is anywhere, it's likely in the remains somewhere.": "",
  "Search the wreck of the Disparity ship.": "",
  "It doesn't take you long to find what you're looking for: a sleek, black box...": "",
  "Open the box.": "",
  "Within the box lies the coordinate fragment. All the lives ended over this... it's up to you to avenge them.": "",
  "Search the wrecks of the Harmony ships.": "",
  "Amongst the Harmony wreckage you find plenty of worthwhile resources, but not the coordinate fragment... it must be aboard the Disparity ship. If you spend any more time here, though, the fleet will begin to catch up.": "",
  "Spend more time, and search the Disparity wreckage.": "",
  "It takes you a bit of time, but you find what you're looking for: a sleek, black box...": "",
  "You can't afford to waste any more time. Forget the fragment, and forget the Link.": "",
  "Your priorities lie with the Federation first... you cannot allow the Rebellion to catch up to you. You prepare to jump to the next beacon, leaving the fate of this sector in the hands of others.": "",
  "As you land one final, decisive blow against the Disparity Behemoth's mighty crystalline armor, it cracks... and then, it shatters! You've done it, you've won!": "",
  "As the final member of the Disparity Behemoth's crew falls, a screeching cry rings out, and the ship's mighty crystalline hull cracks... and then, it shatters! You've done it, you've won!": "",
  "As you're fighting the Disparity Behemoth, the Seraphim ship is able to get close enough to unleash a devastating barrage of flame that results in many of the enemy's systems catching fire! As that happens, you pick up the Seraphim's comms chatter, \"PURIFICATION: UNDERWAY. INITIATING: SCORCHED SPACE OPERATIONS.\" Sounds like they're getting really into it... keep up the pressure!": "",
  "Together, we can do this!": "",
  "Or, so you thought. As the Disparity Behemoth shatters, a sea of darkness springs forth from its encasement... it surrounds you, the Seraphim, the Link, everything. You watch as some of it coalesces into a strange spatial tear, next to the Link... and then, as the tear reverberates and writhes, you feel as your ship begins to be pulled in... it's having some kind of gravitational effect on the entire area!": "",
  "Brace!": "",
  "As you try your best to resist the darkness' pull, you notice the Seraphim struggling... as well as the wreckage of the Disparity Behemoth. The opportunist in you recalls the Liberator drone aboard... you could choose to swoop in, and save the Seraphim, or go for the wreck and try to claim the drone. You can't do both, though, as the pull is only getting stronger!": "",
  "Save the Seraphim.": "",
  "Making sure to keep your velocity stable enough to not get sucked in, you pull up beside the Seraphim ship... its radiance is breathtaking... and, the heat... no! You can't afford to be distracted right now! Knowing the consequences, you allow the ship's flames to engulf yours as you dock with the ship, but... they don't harm you. You merely feel blessed. A Seraph boards, but the ship is then decoupled as the darkness' strength surges... you have to get out of here, now! You've done all you can!": "",
  "Giving the engines all you've got, you blast out of the void, going some distance before you feel entirely safe. Once the coast is clear, you turn to the Seraph... their radiance is even more divine in person. They speak, \"Harmony Link: disconnected from Harmony. Enigma: Harmony Link was not destroyed; merely disconnected manually. Hypothesis: Disparity knew defeat to be imminent; to win in combat was never their directive. Hypothesized Disparity directive: reach Harmony Link, and allow taint to spread...\" they pause, and look straight at you, \"...conclusion: Tainted One has won. Multiverse: grows darker.\"": "",
  "Tainted One?": "",
  "They continue, \"Tainted One's names: innumerous... relevant database results: Tainted One, Dark One, Dark God, Liberator, Tempest, Divinity, Father...\" it pauses, \"...subsequent database entries: corrupted. Source of corruption: unknown; deemed irrelevant. Seraphim directive updated: bide time. Federation: aligned with Seraphim directive.\" Before it can continue, the flames wreathing the Seraph intensify, and an unfamiliar and ethereal voice speaks from it, \"YOU HAVE ONE OF MY OWN, RENEGADE. WIELD IT WELL. I WILL BE WATCHING OVER BOTH OF YOU.\" The voice's divine embrace fades, and the Seraph's flames calm once more. You're not privy to the implications, but... you suppose, at least for now, that everything is over. Even though the Link is lost, the Seraph appears to hold out hope for something... you decide you'll hold out hope, too.": "",
  "Sunday": "",
  "Let's head out, then!": "",
  "As you prepare to set off, though... something amidst the space outside catches your attention. You quickly realize what it is - that same tear in space that you'd seen within the darkness, devouring the Link... only, it seems to have calmed now. How did it get out here?": "",
  "(The Shade) Behind you, the cloaked figure stirs...": "",
  "For the first time ever, you spot the Shade moving in the presence of no enemies. You notice that its gaze seems fixated on the spacetime anomaly outside... and it hits you. You've seen one of these gaps in the seams before, when you first met the Shade - back in the domain of the Dark God...": "",
  "Pondering this, you almost miss as something within the Shade's cloak glows... and the tear outside begins to resonate.": "",
  "Wait, what are you doing?": "",
  "You don't get a verbal answer - rather, you receive a very, very physical one... as a shockwave roars out from the strange gap in space, and you find your ship being pulled in at impossible speeds! There's no escaping this - you need to grab onto something, and fast!": "",
  "Reach out for something!": "",
  "Turn away from the strange thing.": "",
  "You've no intention of messing with this thing, with no expertise of your own - who knows what it could do to you. More than satisfied in leaving the tear in space alone, you find yourself preparing to head out once more.": "",
  "Save the Liberator drone.": "",
  "Making sure to keep your velocity stable enough to not get sucked in, you pull up beside the wreckage of the Disparity Behemoth... you feel warm as you do so, as if... embraced... no! You can't afford to be distracted right now! Knowing the consequences, you dive into the darkness as it spills out from the ship, but... it doesn't harm you. You merely feel loved. Spotting the drone, you pull it out from the wreck and barely make it back aboard as the Disparity Behemoth decouples, and you realize the darkness' strength is surging... you have to get out of here, now! You've done all you can!": "",
  "Giving the engines all you've got, you blast out of the void, going some distance before you feel entirely safe. Once the coast is clear, you turn to the drone... it radiates a certain aura of menace, and you can't help but think of what it was supposed to represent. Liberation... with the Harmony Link being sucked into the void, you can only imagine what's become of it. You suppose the Disparity's won, in a way... but, what of their leader? Are they not doomed without them? Or, is somebody else pulling the strings... you think on so many questions, but realize you have so few answers. Though, perhaps this drone can still be used for its namesake, in your hands. With newfound strength, you prepare to continue on your journey... to liberate the Multiverse from the Rebellion.": "",
  "As you land one final, decisive blow against the Seraphim Judicator's flaming hull, it breaks apart! You've done it, you've won!": "",
  "As the final member of the Seraphim Judicator's crew falls, a heavenly screech rings out, and the ship breaks apart! You've done it, you've won!": "",
  "As you're fighting the Seraphim Judicator, the Disparity Behemoth is able to get close enough to unleash a devastating beam of darkness that results in numerous breaches in the enemy's systems! As that happens, you pick up the Disparity's comms chatter, \"SUBJECT: HUNGER. SUBJECT STATUS: UNSATISFIED. DEVOUR. DEVOUR. Devour? Devour!\" Sounds like they're getting really into it... keep up the pressure!": "",
  "Or, so you thought. As the Seraphim die, they send out one final trump card: a brilliant beam of light that pierces the Disparity Behemoth's hull. As it cracks, and shatters, a sea of darkness springs forth from its encasement... it surrounds you, the Disparity, the Link, everything. You watch as some of it coalesces into a sphere, next to the Link... and then, as the sphere reverberates and writhes, you feel as your ship begins to be pulled in... it's having some kind of gravitational effect on the entire area!": "",
  "As you try your best to resist the darkness' pull, you notice the Disparity struggling... as well as the wreckage of the Seraphim Judicator.

  "Giving the engines all you've got, you blast out of the void, going some distance before you feel entirely safe.

STATUS: cold... b-b-brothers... brotherssssss...\" They appear to melt slightly, but then reform, \"SUBJECT: brothers... they did what they had to! What they h-h-had to! Captainnn, we did it!

Done... brothers, brothers need help! Y-y-you, captainnnn, among them... SUBJECT: CAPTAIN. SUBJECT STATUS: BROTHER. L-l-lead theee way, captain!\" They begin sliding away, and you can't help but notice that despite the loss of their flagship, their kin, and the Link... they seem somewhat jovial. I suppose you have accomplished a great victory here, defeating the Seraphim and destroying the Harmony Link. Although, you have to wonder... was it really destroyed? Hey, wait! You never asked the Engi their name!": "",
  "Wait! I never got your name!": "",
  "As opposed to turning around, the Engi's face shifts to the opposite side of their body. They speak, \"WE: ARE THE HUNGER.\" With that, their face flips back around and they slowly leave... a strange one, indeed!": "",

I ENVY YOU.\" A blinding light manifests in the room, and as it fades... you see a weapon before you, unlike any you've ever seen before. \"THESE ENGI... I HAVE CLAIMED THEM. FOR ONE SUCH AS YOURSELF, I WOULD REFORGE THEM IN YOUR HONOR. GO FORTH, AND DO AS YOU SEE FIT.\" Indeed, you shall. That's all you've ever done, for as long as you can remember.": "",
  "Next to the weapon, the Arbiter drone also manifests...": "",
  "...as well as the Liberator drone.": "",
  "As you prepare to set off, though... something amidst the space outside catches your attention. You quickly realize what it is, as the Dark God has left it here for you - a tear in reality. A gap in the seams...": "",
  "Turn away from the gift.": "",
  "You've made it! The Harmony Link... the lifeblood of the Engi under the Harmony in this sector, and a vital target for the Disparity.": "",
  "A bolt of light streams past your window, and you realize you aren't the first to make it here... in the middle of combat are the two ships you saw when you first entered this beacon: the flaming and colossal ships.": "",
  "Approach the conflict.": "",
  "As you approach, it's the ethereal flaming ship that hails you, and you're met with the visage of a most otherworldly Engi... winged, and wreathed in flames, they carry with them a certain divine aura. They speak, \"Tainted subjects: seek Harmony Link's destruction. Possibility of successful tainted subject purification in the event of no Federation assistance: low. Seraphim request: Federation assistance.\" If they can't stop them, what hope do you have? Though, maybe with your strength combined...": "",
  "We've already made our choice. Stand with the Seraphim.": "",
  "While the two of you are speaking, the colossal Disparity ship notices your arrival and hails as well. The Engi you're speaking to is... strange, and sort of... blobby. Their speech is erratic, \"F-F-F-Federation, hates: hates? [LIBERATION.] Hates, hates, hates... us? SUBJECT: HINDRANCE. H-h-hindraaaance... hindrances will be-be-beee [DEVOURED.] Devoured! And we... ewweewwe WE: will be [LIBERATED.] For... for: WE: ARE THE [HUNGER.] WE: ARE THE [LIBERATOR.] SUBJECT STATUS: Dying! Dying dying d-d-dying...? Dying... dying dy-\" Communications are cut, and the hulking behemoth of a ship lurches its way to face you... this is it. Show them the strength of your convictions, and know you don't stand alone on the path you've chosen!": "",
  "As you approach, it's the hulking Disparity ship that hails you, and you're met with the visage of a strange Engi. They're sort of... blobby. Their speech is erratic, \"SUBJECT: C-c-c-captain! You're... here? Here! You're h-h-here, captain! STATE: HUNGER UNSATISFIED. Devour! D-d-devooooour...? DESIRE: DEVOUR HARMONY LINK. Request: request: request: h-h-heeeelp out, please? Please! The flames! Flamesflamessemalffffff- they b-b-burn, caaaptain!\" So, they need help dealing with the other ship... if they can't stop them, what hope do you have? Though, maybe with your strength combined...": "",
  "We've already made our choice. Stand with the Disparity.": "",
  "While the two of you are speaking, the flaming ship notices your arrival and hails as well. The Engi you're speaking to is wreathed in flame, held afloat by the beating of angelic wings... they speak, \"Subject: Federation. Subject status: tainted. Tainted subject protocol: purification required. Awaiting purification command.\" A moment passes, and they speak again; this time with much more volume and a hint of anger, \"PURIFICATION: UNDERWAY. INITIATING: SCORCHED SPACE OPERATIONS.\" Communications are cut, and the ethereal wisp of a ship darts its way over to face you... this is it. Show them the strength of your convictions, and know you don't stand alone on the path you've chosen!": "",
  "Let's get this over with.": "",
  "Suddenly, the entire beacon is shrouded in shadow... what tricks is the Dark God playing now? Within the darkness, a ship appears. You realize it's the colossal ship you saw when you first entered this sector, but it's red now... and, as opposed to writhing darkness, it's ethereal flames that burns within the crystal.": "",
  "Did those two...?": "",
  "Before you can ponder too long, the ship hails... and you're met with the visage of two very different but simultaneously strange Engi: one blobby and short, and the other winged and wreathed in flame. The blobby one speaks, \"SUBJECT: C-c-captain. SUBJECT STATUS: THREAT TO ALL ENGI.\" The winged one corroborates, \"Subject status: tainted. Taint status: ERROR... incalculable. Awaiting purification command.\" That's cute. They're afraid of you, so they've put aside their differences to try to stand a chance. Enemy of my enemy, and such.": "",
  "Scare them a little bit. Fly closer.": "",
  "The ship glimmers in response, letting off a resplendent glow that lights even the shadows around you ablaze... oh, this ought to be interesting. The Engi speak, simultaneously, \"INITIATING: DEVOUR PROTOCOL.\" So it begins!": "",
  "You arrive at the store beacon, and the voice speaks, \"An Enlightened... merchant lies here. Yet, while... aware of your presence, they show no signs... of aggression towards you. Would you like me... to part the veil?\"": "",
  "Part it. Let's see what we're working with.": "",
  "The darkness recedes, and sure enough, an Enlightened ship lies idle here. If they're bothered by the newfound pocket of clarity, they don't show any signs of it.": "",
  "Contact the merchant.": "",
  "The Enlightened merchant recognizes your aggression and prepares to defend itself.": "",
  "Keep it up, I'm getting out of here.": "",
  "\"Understood.\" The voice goes quiet, and you're left alone with the darkness.": "",
  "The merchant accepts your hail, \"Outsiders... Walking tribute, maybe, but... also walking wallets. I... wouldn't mind the business, even if... you're doomed here.\" The Enlightened open up their store to you.": "",
  "Your hails don't go through. Suddenly, the merchant ship turns towards yours, weapons charging; get ready for a fight!": "",
  "Supposedly, there's a merchant in the darkness here. The voice, sounding worried, speaks, \"This ship, an Enlightened merchant... there's a breach in its hull. It's... being depressurized. Filled with... this false void. I can part the veil... but do nothing about the darkness they've taken on.\"": "",
  "Do it, I've got to save them!": "",
  "As the void retreats, you get to assess the damage firsthand. Scans indicate that the ship has endured about as much residual decay as most Enlightened ships, but there's a small breach in the hull that's causing the ship to depressurize. It wouldn't take much to close it, at least as a temporary fix, but any crew you send would be enduring the darkness, as well as the vacuum of space.": "",
  "We've got to try! Send a crew member to board and repair their hull.": "",
  "(Repair Drone) Send your drone to repair their hull.": "",
  "(Anaerobic Crew) Send your anaerobic crew to board and repair their hull.": "",
  "We can't risk this. Prepare to leave.": "",
  "There's nothing we can afford to do, surely. At least, that's what you tell yourself as you leave the Enlightened to die. The voice keeps silent, and you're left staring into the infinite void.": "",
  "If they're going to die anyway, we might as salvage what we can...": "",
  "\"I... see. Whatever assists you... in your survival.\" You're undisturbed as you scrap and loot the Enlightened merchant, though... the corpses that stare at you through the tears you create don't leave you 'undisturbed.'": "",
  "Keep it up, this is a lost cause.": "",
  "\"I... understand. There is much... at stake.\" The voice goes quiet, and you're left alone with the darkness.": "",
  "Your crew member, short on time, oxygen, and sight, miraculously manages to board, find the breach and seal it for the time being. With oxygen returning to the ship, the Enlightened on board slowly regain consciousness. Before long, they hail you, \"Tribute... some may call you, and yet... you've saved us when the Dark One... could not. Our wares... are open to you, outsider.\" The voice then speaks to you, \"Not all of my kind... are blinded by their zeal. Some of them... are just blinded, literally.\" It seems pleased with itself.": "",
  "Your crew member manages to board but the darkness is unnavigable. They spend a few moments blindly stumbling their way through the void before they bump into something... it's a Deep One, and they're still alive! You make the decision to pull your crew out before they run out of oxygen, or worse, succumb to the darkness; they take the Deep One with them.": "",
  "Upon returning to the ship, you get an actual look at this Deep One, and the voice speaks to you: \"This one... is blessed, or cursed, by the False God... depending on who you ask. All Enlightened... follow their God, and the... 'chosen' among them lead. To be chosen... is to ascend, in their eyes. In reality...\" it pauses, \"...it is nothing but a lie. In exchange for power... they trade their very soul.\" The voice ends on this, and you're left with the strange Deep One. They assert that you must have been sent by the Dark God itself to save them, and after a quick prayer they insist that they must now return His mercy and help you via working aboard your ship. Odd...": "",
  "Your crew member manages to board but the darkness is unnavigable. They spend a few moments blindly stumbling their way through the void before... their comms are cut. They were talking one moment, and gone the next. Before you can really react, you see the ship outside break apart, splitting in half; there, where the two halves split... you see something. Your crew member, staring back at you; unphased by the encroaching darkness and unmoved by both the violent tearing of the ship and the vacuum of space. The darkness envelops them, and all is lost. The voice offers no answers.": "",
  "Somehow, your crew member's DNA backups seem to have been... corrupted? Completely unusable, you can't bring them back. This accursed place...": "",
  "You locate the breach and manage to seal it for the time being. With oxygen returning to the ship, the Enlightened on board slowly regain consciousness. Before long, they hail you, \"Tribute... some may call you, and yet... you've saved us when the Dark One... could not. Our wares... are open to you, outsider.\" The voice then speaks to you, \"Not all of my kind... are blinded by their zeal. Some of them... are just blinded, literally.\" It seems pleased with itself.": "",
  "You locate the breach and manage to seal it, but many of the Deep Ones have already been lost; only one remains. After regaining consciousness, they assert that you must have been sent by the Dark God itself to save them, and after a quick prayer they insist that they must now return His mercy and help you via working aboard your ship. Odd...": "",
  "When they arrive on your ship, you get an actual look at this Deep One, and the voice speaks to you: \"This one... is blessed, or cursed, by the False God... depending on who you ask. All Enlightened... follow their God, and the... 'chosen' among them lead. To be chosen... is to ascend, in their eyes. In reality...\" it pauses, \"...it is nothing but a lie. In exchange for power... they trade their very soul.\" The voice ends on this, and you're left with the strange Deep One.": "",
  "Though you can't see anything, you hear gunfire through the darkness. The voice speaks, \"One... of the blue ships lies here. A... rare sight. They're either newcomers, or... have no intention of following the False God. Regardless... they appear to be shooting at the darkness, not just... into it. Shall I... part the veil?\"": "",
  "This sounds interesting. Part it.": "",
  "The Deep One ship comes into view as the pocket of space expands. They hail you, startled, \"What... is this? The darkness... retreats? Have our attacks... worked?\" After thinking on this for a moment, they continue, \"Perhaps... you have something to do with this, Federation? What... brings you into this damnable void?\"": "",
  "Sort of on a mission to save reality, and the Enlightened.": "",
  "\"Here to free... our brethren? They're enthralled by this... 'Dark God,' by the promise of... power. Many of our kin... travel here, from across space, seeking its... favor. Yet...\" it pauses, \"...there's a strange... falseness, to this darkness. As... we fire into it, it recedes, if only... for a moment. If you're here to free our kin from this... prison, allow us to assist.\" They offer their wares to you and, while you shop, send a couple Deep Ones over to repair what they can. In the meantime, the voice keeps quiet; you imagine it has to be pretty pleased with the nuance being presented by its kind here, though.": "",
  "I'm here to kick ass, yours included!": "",
  "\"Perhaps... our kin were right to seek refuge.\" They cut communications, and prepare to defend themselves as you begin your assault.": "",
  "I don't want anything to do with whatever's happening over there.": "",
  "\"Not... a terrible call.\" The voice goes quiet, and you're left alone with the darkness. Well, and with the distant sound of weapons being fired into the void.": "",
  "Shadows erupt from the Templar as it's defeated, but, as opposed to being destroyed, it seems to enter a powered down state. More important than that, though, is the fact that this Templar in particular was such a threat... why don't all of the Enlightened carry ones this strong?": "",
  "Hail the merchants back.": "",
  "The Enlightened are ecstatic at hearing the news of the Templar's defeat, and you ask them about its current condition. Collectively, they seem hesitant to answer, but one of the Deep Ones speaks up, \"It... has lost the Dark One's blessing. It... is powerless, now. Serves it... right, for betraying us! It... must have broken free of the Dark One's will! Death... to the betrayer!\" There's an uproar of assent as the Enlightened all praise their Dark God, continuing to celebrate your defeat of the Templar as if their deity had willed it itself.": "",
  "I'll just hold onto it, then. Now, with that settled...": "",
  "There's no disagreement from the merchants as you decide to keep what remains of their Templar, and they rush to show you their wares in thanks.": "",
  "The voice seems startled as you pull into the beacon, \"My... kin are here, yes, but... there seems to be some sort of struggle... aboard their ship. Would you... wish to help them?\"": "",
  "I can sure try!": "",
  "An appreciative grunt sounds out within your head as the shadows outside are parted, and you're indeed met with the visage of an Enlightened merchant vessel. They seem to be at a standstill within the void outside, though, so you request to hail and get a better picture of what's happening. An Enlightened Cultist answers, and they speak to you frantically, \"Outsider! We... need help! O', Dark One, forgive us... our Templar has lost control! What did we... do wrong, o' Dark One? Why do you... punish us so?\" The Deep One continues to lament to their uncaring deity, as if you weren't even there.": "",
  "Your, uh... Templar, you say?": "",
  "The Deep One's head snaps back towards you, regardless of their lack of eyes, \"Oh, why... yes. It was supposed to be... a gift, for our tribute, but... it's lost control! It's... rampaging throughout the ship, smashing things... recklessly! O', Dark One... why?\"": "",
  "Have you tried to jettison it?": "",
  "\"We have, but... it just comes back. We're... being punished! Punished, for... our sins! Please, o' Dark One... forgive us!\" With the Enlightened being as vulnerable as they are in a fight, you suppose that they can't handle the drone themselves and would sooner stand around praying to the void around them than try to deal with it.": "",
  "The void may not answer, but I will. Send that Templar this way!": "",
  "The Enlightened thank you for your intervention, and move to lure their Templar back into an airlock...": "",
  "...and it doesn't take long for them to jettison it in your direction, grabbing its attention!": "",
  "They can keep praying. I don't want to deal with this.": "",
  "These Enlightened are hardly acknowledging your presence as is, and you're not sure you want to risk a one-on-one tussle with one of the Dark God's creations. You end the call, and you're not sure if they even notice... but that doesn't mean that your cowardice has gone unseen.": "",
  "I'd really rather not.": "",
  "Store beacon be damned, you don't trust a single thing in this hellish place. The voice sighs within your head, \"Very... well, then. Do as you wish.\" It then goes quiet, and you're left alone with your thoughts. Your thoughts, and the, uh... fathomless expanse of darkness outside.": "",
  "You expect to hear the voice call out to you as you arrive at the beacon, but nothing is heard. There must be nothing here... nothing but you, and the void.": "",
  "There's a concerning flash of light from behind your ship, and you hear the voice speak, \"It's nothing... to be concerned about. The ship I've... commandeered is simply a little... faulty. This beacon is empty.\" It goes silent. All is silent...": "",
  "After a moment of silence, the voice speaks, \"There's... nothing of note here.\" It ends on that, rather abruptly. Left alone, you stare out into the void, and part of you wonders how long you could last in this endless sea of darkness before truly losing it.": "",
  "Arriving at the beacon, you're partially hoping that this has all been a dream and that there might be light in store for you here. There isn't. No light, no voice, just... darkness. You hope, for your sake, that that is truly all that's here.": "",
  "With the guard defeated, the prison ship lies defenseless; they're surrendering.": "",
  "Board, let's find the hold.": "",
  "The Enlightened begrudgingly allow you onboard, but it's not like they have much of a choice. You demand that they show you the prisoners, and they abide; within the hold, about a dozen Deep Ones lie huddled together in the corner. What should you do?": "",
  "Free them.": "",
  "You open the hold's door and make it clear that they're free to leave, but they seem insistent on staying. Where would they go, anyways? There's nowhere safe for you to leave them in this sector, and there's not much left for them outside it...": "",
  "Surely, there's somewhere they can go?": "",
  "You're pondering this when the voice speaks to you, \"If my kin... insist on staying in this prison, then leave them... in this cage, within a cage. Perhaps... the cage is all they know. Regardless, I appreciate... your efforts.\" It goes quiet. Feeling somewhat defeated, you suppose it's time to take your leave. As you prepare to jump to the next beacon, you stare into the void and think about the voice's words. Are you any more free than those Deep Ones, in this 'cage?'": "",
  "(Deep One Cultist) Your Enlightened Cultist seems to have something to say.": "",
  "You give it the floor, and it prepares a most eloquent speech... entirely composed of grunts, growls and screams. Though you don't understand an ounce of it, it seems to have rallied the prisoners; they leave their cell and begin to revolt against their captors! Outnumbered, and with you standing there, menacingly, the prison guards have no choice but to give up control of the ship to the former prisoners. Let's see how they like being caged... Now free, the Deep Ones you've saved muster up what few resources they can to thank you, and one of them asks to join you! The voice speaks, approvingly, \"To... see them rise up, against their captors...\" it pauses, \"...it fills me with hope. Hope for my people... and their future.\" It ends on that, and you're left with the spoils of heroism.": "",
  "Enslave them.": "",
  "Though most of them resist, and are dealt with accordingly, one obedient prisoner remains. Content, and with your newfound slave in tow, you return to your ship and prepare to leave the beacon. The silence is deafening as the FTL charges.": "",
  "Cowards. Destroy them.": "",
  "They can do little as you tear into them. It doesn't take long for the damage they take to prove catastrophic; the prison ship explodes, and is yours to scrap. The silence is deafening as you gather what you can.": "",
  "The voice, concerned, speaks to you, \"My kin...\" it pauses, \"...An Enlightened prison ship, and its guard... lie at this beacon. This... is where kin turn on kin. Zealots... turn on 'blasphemers.' In the name... of a False God...\" It seems really emotional about this... After it takes a moment to collect itself, the voice continues, \"They... have no intention of attacking you and risking their... 'cargo.' Should you... wish to play the hero, I can abate this... accursed darkness.\"": "",
  "I can do this. Render this void, void.": "",
  "The darkness recedes, and you can see the prison ship some distance away... First, though, you've got to get through its guard, who turns to face you once they realize they've lost their precious veil!": "",
  "I'm no hero. Keep it up.": "",
  "\"Of... course.\" It says nothing else on the matter, and you're left staring into the void as the FTL charges.": "",
  "You arrive at the beacon, and... nothing. It's just you and the void; the voice remains silent. Suppose there's nothing of value here.": "",
  "Before you can move to do anything, you see a bright flash from outside pierce the darkness! Only briefly, though... it's gone as quickly as it came. Seconds later, the voice calls to you, \"Kin, from outside. These... are no Enlightened. They aren't... aware of your presence, but shall I... remedy that?\"": "",
  "Sure, let me see them. Wonder what brings them here...": "",
  "The darkness outside recedes, and the Deep One ship is slowly made visible. It's a bit of a sight for sore eyes in this cultist abyss... They're just kind of floating there, though; they make no attempts to hail you.": "",
  "Make the first move, hail them.": "",
  "They quickly accept your hail, but you're not exactly sure what to make of the sight being presented here... the Deep Ones are, like, running around screaming? It's not \"I'm in mortal danger, please save me!\" screaming, though, they look, like, ecstatic? About something? Or something?": "",
  "What is going on here?": "",
  "\"You!\" A Deep One points at the screen, \"You... have the power! The Dark One's... favor!\" They must be talking about the darkness outside retreating... they're just shy of frothing at the mouth over this. What do you say?": "",
  "Yeah, I'm the Dark God's Chosen. I'm a pretty big deal.": "",
  "Their eyes widen to the point that it feels absurd. \"His... HIS...\" they all collectively scream, \"HIS CHOSEN?! HIS... CHOSEN HAS NOTICED... US?!\" With that, all hell breaks loose; they literally just start smashing everything. It doesn't take long for one of them to accidentally start the FTL amidst all the commotion... After they've vanished, the voice calls to you, amused, \"Well... outsiders they may be, it seems that... they'll fit in with the zealots just fine.\" Then, silence. You quickly realize how much you appreciate having a silly distraction as you're left staring into the darkness, alone.": "",
  "(Deep One Cultist) Yep. Got my own cult and everything.": "",
  "\"Your own... cult?\" one of them asks, before briefly thinking on it and continuing, \"Can... I join it?\"": "",
  "Hell yeah! It's a party over here!": "",
  "The Deep One screams as it runs out of the room and makes for the teleporter. Moments later, he's then teleported straight into your room; he proceeds to continue screaming. The Deep Ones, over the hail, are also screaming. Your Enlightened Cultist... is screaming. They don't really tire themselves out either, they kinda just keep doing it. Eventually, like all good things, it has to come to an end... and it ends with you mumbling something under your breath while ending the call and demanding that the FTL be fired. The voice merely laughs, amused.": "",
  "Nah. Only so much coolness to go around... supply and demand, and all that.": "",
  "At first, it seems saddened by this response, but then it leaves the room after gaining a certain air of determination. Moments later, it comes back carrying as much scrap as it can! \"If... I cannot join your cult, directly... I will form a second cult here, in your... mighty name! Please... oh please, take this offering!\" Most deities would probably be offended if offered a heaping pile of garbage as tribute, but you? It's hard to name a better gift...": "",
  "The scrap is transferred and, after you hang up on your newfound worshippers, the voice speaks, \"There's... more value to this than you may... realize. The False God gains its power... from belief. It's useless to you or I, but, to it... it is everything. To convert its followers... is humorous, to say the least, but also... a tactical advantage.\" It then goes quiet, and you're left pondering the logistics of belief-power... you surmise that it's sort of like scrap, but for Gods.": "",
  "Are you kidding me? I hate that Dark God guy.": "",
  "The Deep Ones, in unison, immediately go silent and stop moving. They're all staring directly at you as the call ends, abruptly. You're not really sure how they did that without moving... and before you can think on it, you realize their ship has turned towards yours, weapons charging!": "",
  "Fine. I didn't want to talk to them anyways...": "",
  "The ship continues to merely float there, and you're uninterrupted as you wait for the FTL to charge.": "",
  "How rude of them. Attack!": "",
  "You can't stand the gall of these weird fish-people. How can they sleep at night knowing they're the type to not call random, nearby ships on sight? You make the order to attack and, recognizing your aggression, the ship outside prepares to defend itself.": "",
  "I prefer my presence unknown, thanks.": "",
  "\"Suit... yourself.\" The voice goes quiet. You're left staring into nothing, and you think about how badly you miss the stars.": "",
  "Before you can move to... do nothing, you see a bright flash from outside pierce the darkness! Only briefly, though... it's gone as quickly as it came. Seconds later, the voice calls to you, \"Kin, from outside. These... are no Enlightened. They aren't... aware of your presence, but shall I... remedy that?\"": "",
  "The void, ever-present, leaves you waiting for the voice's guidance. It doesn't leave you waiting long, though, \"Enlightened... lie at this beacon. Though, it's... strange. This ship is a hunter, yet... they're not showing any signs of aggression. Should I... push back this false darkness?\"": "",
  "As the darkness is pulled back, the ship seems to continue retreating further and further back into it; eventually, though, it gives up and hails you, \"I... don't understand. Prey... here, and the Dark One's protection forsakes me...\" It seems really worked up about this.": "",
  "Why were you not attacking me? Aren't you a hunter?": "",
  "It seems surprised, \"How did you...\" it pauses, \"Wait. This... this, is a test. A test... of faith. The Dark One wishes that I... prove my devotion. Hear me, then, and let my faith... be known!\" The Enlightened cut communications, and their weapons come online!": "",
  "Looks like your Dark God's abandoned you.": "",
  "It seems to ponder this for a moment. \"Truth be told... I've been considering abandoning it, too. Word's arrived... that your 'Rebellion' pushes into our territory... unabated. Our teachings would leave you thinking this... to be impossible, and yet...\" The Enlightened goes quiet for a while. Eventually, it continues, \"If... if the Dark One has failed us, then... what good is staying here, waiting to die?\"": "",
  "\"I've... made up my mind. I'm coming with you, Federation, and... seeing what the universe has to offer. I've... much to learn, to adapt to, but...\" it pauses, \"...I'd rather die in the light, than live any longer... cowering in this darkness.\" It ends communications, and you spot it... swimming through space, and onto your ship. The voice then speaks, \"My kin... breaking free from their shackles. Seeing through... the facade...\" It doesn't continue, but you have to imagine that it's rather pleased with the whole situation.": "",
  "So, you're vulnerable then? Attack!": "",
  "\"What good... is this darkness, if...\" It doesn't continue, but you don't really care, either. You cut communications and prepare to begin your assault.": "",
  "I don't want to take my chances with a hunter.": "",
  "\"Fair... enough.\" The voice goes quiet, and you're a little nervous as you wait for the FTL to charge.": "",
  "After you're done salvaging, the voice briefly speaks to you, \"Strange... individuals, without a doubt. One has to wonder... how they got this deep into the void.\" It goes silent, and you're left doing just that; wondering.": "",
  "You're not given even a second alone before the voice calls to you, shocked, \"Rocks... here? Bearing strange colors, even... They seem completely lost. Do you... wish to see them?\"": "",
  "The darkness wanes, and you get to see this Rock ship firsthand. It appears to be vaguely crystalline, and painted in gold, bearing a strange insignia...": "",
  "...I have no idea what this is.": "",
  "This isn't like any Rock ship you've seen before. Regardless, they hail you, and you're met with the sight of a couple robed Rocks. One of them speaks, \"Greetings, uh, Federation! Fancy meeting you here... You wouldn't happen to, uh, know where here is, would you?\"": "",
  "You're in an artificial void inhabited by the Enlightened.": "",
  "He scratches his head, \"The light-who now?\"": "",
  "They're a cult of Deep Ones who worship an entity they call the Dark God.": "",
  "He stops you at the word 'cult,' \"OH! See, I told you!\" he looks to the other Rock, \"That Free Mantis was right, this is the Cultist Void!\" The other Rock simply grunts. The former then turns back to you, \"Wait, if this is the Cultist Void... what are you doing here?\"": "",
  "Uh... Just passing through...": "",
  "He squints, \"Here to steal our occult secrets, I'm sure... Well, you can't have them! Get your own secrets, and your own void!\" They cut communications and their weapons come online, they're preparing to attack!": "",
  "(Cultist Crew) I'm friends with so many cultists.": "",
  "His eyes go wide, \"BROTHER! Oho, now I KNOW I'm dreaming! Gorthocc, slap me!\" The second rock slaps him, hard, and he's... knocked out cold. Or dead, you can't really tell. Regardless, uh, 'Gorthocc' isn't much of a talker, and he leaves the room... before you know it, though, he's on your ship! Your Rock Cultist explains that him and Gorthocc go way back, and that he was apparently getting really tired of that other Rock guy. Is he actually dead...? Regardless, Gorthocc has joined your crew!": "",
  "Gorthocc": "",
  "(Deep One Cultist) I'm friends with so many cultists.": "",
  "He spends a while squinting at your Deep One, before saying \"Is that, like... a suit?\" He then takes a look at his own robes. \"Kinda wish I had something like that, actually. Wardrobe's really lacking in the 'anything-but-blue-robes' department, and a fish suit could work.\" He blinks, \"What were we, uh, talking about?\"": "",
  "Cult stuff.": "",
  "\"Ah, of course! I love cult stuff, can't get enough of this Cultist Void!\" He looks past the screen and out the window, and you see him shiver a little bit. \"Now, say, like, hypothetically... one DID get enough of this Cultist Void. How exactly would they, you know, leave?\"": "",
  "I've read in, uh, 'occult writings' that giving strangers free stuff helps with escaping Cultist Voids.": "",
  "\"Well, that'd be useful if there were any strangers around...\" He scratches his head for a while, before a surprised look overcomes his face, \"WAIT! You're a stranger!\" He faces the second rock, \"Here, uh... Gorthocc, send some of the relics over, will you? We're out of the stuff we usually send to random strangers.\" He then turns back to you, \"Thanks for getting us out of here. Thought we were, like, LOST for a second there!\" They cut communications and the gift is sent over... you should probably leave before they realize they've been lied to. Assuming they ever realize.": "",
  "(Crystal Crew) I'm friends with God.": "",
  "Upon seeing your Crystal, both Rocks instantly pass out; they collapse to the floor with a loud thud. For a moment, you're unsure what to do, and then one of them wakes up. Then you're unsure what to do again, as they pass out a second time. This cycle repeats for a while before you decide it's probably best to just cut communications... your Crystal looks at you, straight-faced, and sighs as it leaves the room.": "",
  "(Vortigon) \"What do you THINK I'm doing here?\"": "",
  "\"V-Vortigon?! Here? Actually, y-you being in the Cultist Void makes an infinite amount of sense, sir! My deepest apologies, sir!\" The second Rock grunts, apologetically, and they send over a bunch of random stuff as recompense. Vortigon rolls his eyes.": "",
  "This place? It's your grave, pal. Attack!": "",
  "The Rock blinks a few times, before realizing what's going on. \"Oh-ho-ho, so it's like THAT, is it? GORTHOCC! READY THE WEAPO-\" They cut communications mid-sentence. They must be eager for battle... still, not half as eager as you are.": "",
  "Wait, I recognize this ship...": "",
  "That's a ship belonging to the Cult of the Eternal Ember! They hail you, and you're met with the sight of a couple Rock Cultists. One of them speaks, \"Greetings, uh, Federation! Fancy meeting you here... You wouldn't happen to, uh, know where here is, would you?\"": "",
  "His eyes go wide, \"BROTHER! Oho, now I KNOW I'm dreaming! Gorthocc, slap me!\" The second rock slaps him, hard, and he's... knocked out cold. Or dead, you can't really tell. Regardless, uh, 'Gorthocc' isn't much of a talker, and he leaves the room... Before you know it, though, he's on your ship! Your Rock Cultist explains that him and Gorthocc go way back, and that he was apparently getting really tired of that other Rock guy. Is he actually dead...?

  "\"I don't... particularly enjoy seeing Rocks, either.\" The voice goes quiet. As you stare into the darkness, you wonder about the odds of that Rock ship accidentally ramming into you...": "",
  "You fly to the strange, gray ship as soon as you can, but... there doesn't seem to be much left. The ship itself seems to be... melting? Splitting? One of the pieces floats your way, and you realize... it's sentient! You send a crew member out to pick it up, and once it's onboard you get a closer look at it; quite literally just a large, gray blob of goo. It seems grateful for being saved, though, and starts rolling around the ship. Guess you've got a new crew member!": "",
  "You fly to the Morph ship as soon as you can, but... there doesn't seem to be much left. The ship, composed of individual Morphs, is falling apart... One of the Morphs, seemingly the sole survivor, floats towards your ship and you send a crew member out to pick it up. Once it's onboard, it seems grateful for your hospitality and begins rolling around, content. Guess you've got a new crew member!": "",
  "You fly to the Enlightened ship as soon as you can, but... it seems that most of them have suffocated by now. One remains, unconscious; you get them onboard and do all you can to resuscitate them, and... after a few minutes, they come to! They express their gratitude and, seeing that everyone they knew is now dead, offer to join your crew.": "",
  "The voice speaks to you with a certain air of confusion, \"There's...\" it pauses, \"...two Kin ships here, though... one of them is... odd, to say the least. Care... to look?\"": "",
  "Sounds intriguing, sure.": "",
  "The void is pushed back, and you see two ships; one's... a gray Enlightened Fighter, without any lights? They're just sort of... flying around, sporadically. The other is also an Enlightened ship, and it hails you as soon as it realizes you can see them, \"First, these... impostors, and now the darkness falls? What... is happening?\"": "",
  "I'd like to ask you the same thing.": "",
  "Just then, the gray ship joins the call; you see a group of gray, eyeless Deep Ones on-screen. One of them speaks, \"Jip? Wooloo, loo?\" The opposing Enlightened cultist is speechless, for a moment, but then it growls and gives the command to charge the weapons! They're intending to attack the strange, gray ship.": "",
  "Protect the gray ship, attack the Enlightened!": "",
  "You try to get in-between the two ships, but you're too late; a blast from the Enlightened hits the gray ship and deals catastrophic damage. You're not sure they'll make it... Still, you've got to try! The Enlightened, recognizing your aggression, move to make you their next target.": "",
  "I want to get to the bottom of this, attack the gray ship!": "",
  "You try to assist the Enlightened, but before the battle even begins some strange mass of gray goop is launched at them; it's jamming their oxygen and weapons! With them out of commission, you'll have to take on the gray ship alone.": "",
  "I don't want anything to do with this. Get out.": "",
  "You leave the two ships to their fight, and fly away; back into the void... It's sort of comforting, in a weird way.": "",
  "I know about these rascals, they're Morphs.": "",
  "Just then, the Morph ship joins the call; you see a group of Morphs morphed as Deep Ones on-screen. One of them speaks, \"Jip? Wooloo, loo?\" The opposing Enlightened cultist is speechless, for a moment, but then it growls and gives the command to charge the weapons! They're intending to attack the Morph ship.": "",
  "Protect the Morphs, attack the Enlightened!": "",

  "I hate these rascals, actually, attack the Morphs!": "",
  "You try to assist the Enlightened, but before the battle even begins a giant blob of Morphs launches themselves at them; the Morphs are jamming the Enlightened's oxygen and weapons! With them out of commission, you'll have to take on the Morph ship alone.": "",
  "Sounds a little too weird for me.": "",
  "\"Then, I suppose... we'll never know.\" The voice goes quiet, and you're left staring into the darkness as the FTL charges, wondering what could have been.": "",
  "Against all odds, you've broken through the Paladins' armor! You quickly salvage what you can.": "",
  "Against all odds, you've slain the Paladins! You quickly salvage what you can.": "",
  "You've just finished looting when the voice speaks to you, \"My kin, some of them... live. One... one ship remains.\" It then guides you to the ship in question, a small vessel not equipped for battle. You hail, and they pick up, \"You... Outsider, prey... you've saved us. Why?\"": "",
  "It's what I do.": "",
  "They think on this for a moment. Then, \"What we do... is engineer work. We theorize... that this is why the Rocks didn't find us. We believe our kin... shooting at them, futilely, led to their locations being found; darkness... be damned.\" They offer to do what they can to repay your debt to them.": "",
  "My reactor could use a little work.": "",
  "The engineers nod, and get to work on your reactor.": "",
  "I need some manpower.": "",
  "One of them looks at you and asks \"What are you looking for, exactly?\"": "",
  "I need a fighter.": "",
  "The engineers nod, and send a Deep One over.": "",
  "I need an enabler for the rest of my crew.": "",
  "The engineers nod, and send an Enlightened Cultist over.": "",
  "(Happy Holidays) I need more of... whatever this is.": "",
  "One of the engineers morphs into a second Happy Holidays, and the rest of the Deep Ones scream in terror. They quickly end communications, but you find that the second Happy Holidays has somehow gotten behind you in the meantime. Crazy rollout.": "",
  "John Holidays": "",
  "Hit me with something exotic.": "",
  "\"Something... exotic?\" They briefly think it over before one of them nods at the other, and they leave the room. They return with... a strange drone, that seems to absorb the very light around it. You'd think this to be moreso Engi technology... \"This... is for you. It was a gift... to us, from the Dark One, in exchange for tribute. Now... it is a gift from us, to you.\" They send it over, and sure enough, it appears to be of Engi design... though it has also been infused with some foul darkness. What's the Dark God doing with Engi technology? The voice provides no answers.": "",
  "You engineers wouldn't happen to have any weaponry, right?": "",
  "\"Any... weaponry?\" They briefly think it over before one of them nods at the other, and they leave the room. They return with... a strange weapon, that seems to absorb the very light around it. \"This... is for you. It was a gift... to us, from the Dark One, in exchange for tribute. Now... it is a gift from us, to you.\" They send it over, and a sense of dread seems to linger in the air around it as you approach. A gift from the Dark One, they said... what eldritch powers are at play here? The voice provides no answers.": "",
  "How about... your lights?": "",
  "\"An... oddly specific request. You have just... saved us, and stopped this Rock's rampage, so... I suppose we can trust you with the Dark One's... favor. You've earned it.\" With that, they spend some time uninstalling the few operational lights they have left, then send them over to you. Getting your hands on them, they make you feel... uncomfortable, to say the least. All you can really tell is that they exude some sort of odd energy, and the voice provides no insight into the matter.": "",
  "Saved you? I just like scrap.": "",
  "They shift uncomfortably. \"Well, regardless... you've saved us. The least we can do... is repay this debt.\" They explain that they're engineers, and offer to do what they can.": "",
  "What part of \"I like scrap\" do you not understand?": "",
  "Again, they look uncomfortable. \"We don't exactly... keep garbage lying around. Is there... anything else that we can offer?\"": "",
  "Relent, choose something else.": "",
  "You notice one of them sigh in relief.": "",
  "They don't get it, do they? Blow them up.": "",
  "\"Wait... ple-\" Communications are cut as their ship buckles, then breaks in half. The silence feels deafening as you loot what you can, but there isn't much... what a waste of time.": "",
  "You arrive to the sight of orange flashes that briefly pierce the darkness, a few seconds in-between each of them. This goes on for a few moments before the voice speaks to you, hardly able to get the words out, \"Kin, here... being... being slaughtered... A Rock vessel, of... a design unknown to me, hunts them. It seems... impervious to weapon fire. I... I know your survival is a priority, Federation, but... my kin...\" It's unable to finish.": "",
  "Light the way, and leave it to me.": "",
  "It says, with hope now tinging its choked speech, \"Thank... thank you, truly.\" With a sense of urgency, the void quickly recedes; a path of carnage now lies before you, Enlightened ships wrecked left and right, and you realize you're face to face with a Rock Paladin.": "",
  "Take a deep breath, and engage.": "",
  "You push forward, and the Paladin ship hails, \"Federation. I know not how you've forced this foul darkness to abate, but it matters little. The Elders demand that the non-believers of this void be purged; you stand, among them. Take peace in the fact that our retribution will be swift.\" They cut communications and prepare to begin their assault... will you simply be another step on their holy warpath, or the one to put an end to this madness?": "",
  "On second thought...": "",
  "Before you can act, the Paladin ship hails, \"Federation. I know not how you've forced this foul darkness to abate, but it matters little. The Elders demand that the non-believers of this void be purged; you stand, among them. Take peace in the fact that our retribution will be swift.\" They cut communications and prepare to begin their assault... will you simply be another step on their holy warpath, or the one to put an end to this madness?": "",
  "I can't do this, I'm sorry.": "",
  "\"But, they're...\" it pauses, \"I...\" It doesn't continue. Awkward, but... 'impervious to weapon fire' doesn't exactly fill you with confidence in regards to your odds of winning. Though, aren't all Rock ships at least somewhat impervious to weapon fire?": "",
  "The void is immediately pulled back, and the voice speaks as an Enlightened ship comes into view, \"Hunter... inbound. Prepare yourself.\"": "",
  "To your surprise, though, they hail you, \"WAIT! Wait, wait, wait!\" You've never seen a Deep One speak so quickly...": "",
  "They breathe a sigh of relief and continue, \"Holy, wow... you're actually here! Wait, you don't know me, uh... I'm, like, a HUGE fan of yours. I spotted you during one of your, um, battles in the Deep One sector. Not, like, THIS one...\" they glance outside past the screen and gulp, \"...the, uh, other one. I don't really like this one. REGARDLESS! I've been following you ever since. Look, I even stole one of these fancy cultist ships!\"": "",
  "That 'fancy cultist ship' almost got you killed...": "",
  "\"YEAH, but, like, it's cool, isn't it? I'm totally cosplaying as your MORTAL enemy right now!\" They blink a few times, and then say \"Now that I think about it... not the brightest idea, huh? Maybe I'm not cut out for all this stalking business...\"": "",
  "If you want to stalk me better, I've got some tips. I'm a pro stalker.": "",
  "Their eyes light up, \"REALLY?! Wow! I didn't, like, think you could get any cooler... we literally have so much in common!\" They look at you, expectantly.": "",
  "(Cloaking) First, you're gonna want one of these bad boys.": "",
  "\"Oh, I've got one of those on my actual stalking ship! Not really sure what this ship has, kinda just hijacking it... anyways, way ahead of you stalker pro!\"": "",
  "(Adv. Cloaking) Your stalker power PALES in comparison to mine.": "",
  "They jump back in shock, \"A whole FIFTEEN seconds, MINIMUM?! Wow, you really are a pro!\" they pause, writing something down, \"Ok! I'll make sure to work on my cloaking when I get outta here. Speaking of, um, getting out of here... this place kinda gives me the creeps. I think I'll catch you in the next sector. Not that you'll see me, though, I'm totally becoming a pro stalker!\"": "",
  "\"Before I leave, though, this ship's got all kinds of goods! Not like I need 'em, and how could I pass up a chance to help the Federation? I'm, like, a part of your story now! Lemme rummage around and see what I can find...\" After a few moments of doing just that, they send over a bunch of random stuff... including a weapon! \"Okay, stalker pro! Good luck, and I'll be seeing you!\" With that, they leave the system, and the voice calls to you, \"A... charismatic lass, to say the least.\" You almost think you hear the faintest hint of a smile behind its words...": "",
  "Perhaps there's nothing I can teach you, after all...": "",
  "\"Aw... Don't be down, you're still a stalker pro in my heart!\" they glance around for a moment, before continuing, \"I guess that means I need to figure out this stalker business by myself, though. Still, I won't give up! I'll catch you in the next sector, and my stalker power will be so high that you'll never even see me! Good luck, and bye for now!\" They leave the beacon, and you're left alone... save for the voice, who calls to you, \"A... charismatic lass, to say the least.\" You almost think you hear the faintest hint of a smile behind its words...": "",
  "More of a... stalker in training, actually...": "",
  "Have you considered not stalking people?": "",
  "They briefly stare at you, \"Well, how am I supposed to know what happens if I don't stalk you?\"": "",
  "You can come with me.": "",
  "Shocked, they answer, \"And do all that FIGHTING? Sorry, I really respect you, but... I don't think I'm cut out for reality-saving. Stalking's much safer! Still, I really appreciate the offer...\"": "",
  "\"Okay! I've made up my mind. I'm gonna get out of here, and work on my stalking... in the meantime, keep safe, okay? I'll catch you in the next sector! Not that you'll, uh, see me.\" With that, they leave the system, and the voice calls to you, \"A... charismatic lass, to say the least.\" You almost think you hear the faintest hint of a smile behind its words...": "",
  "You can live your own life!": "",
  "They smirk, \"Your life is way more interesting! It almost feels like the whole universe revolves around you, the way you beat up all these bad guys! Still, I really appreciate the sentiment...\"": "",
  "This could be a trick, for all you know. You cut communications and prepare for battle.": "",
  "You fire upon the safe, and you watch as reality itself warps outside; the safe is gone, having teleported away. You're now left with more questions than answers... granted, that's a low bar considering you have zero answers.": "",
  "Your crew member presses the button, and you watch as reality itself warps outside; the safe is gone, having teleported away, and in its place lies a small heap of scrap... You're not really sure what just happened, but scrap is scrap. Plus, your crew member's fine!": "",
  "Your crew member presses the button, and you watch as reality itself warps outside; the safe is gone, having teleported away, and in its place lies a few nodes of fuel... You're not really sure what just happened, but fuel is fuel. Plus, your crew member's fine!": "",
  "Your crew member presses the button, and you watch as reality itself warps outside; the safe is gone, having teleported away, and in its place lies a few missiles... You're not really sure what just happened, but missiles are missiles. Plus, your crew member's fine!": "",
  "Your crew member presses the button, and you watch as reality itself warps outside; the safe is gone, having teleported away, and in its place lies a small heap of drone parts... You're not really sure what just happened, but drone parts are drone parts. Plus, your crew member's fine!": "",
  "The voice seems confused when you arrive at the beacon, \"What? How... can I not...\" It continues to mumble to itself.": "",
  "Ask it what's wrong.": "",
  "\"Well, there's... some sort of... vault, floating here. The thing that troubles me, is... I cannot see into it.\" The void is pushed back and, sure enough, there's a giant safe floating in space here... What should you do?": "",
  "Send someone out to open it.": "",
  "Your crew member reports back that there's a numpad attached to the safe, asking for a four digit combination. What number should they press?": "",
  "1.": "",
  "3.": "",
  "5.": "",
  "7.": "",
  "8.": "",
  "9.": "",
  "0.": "",
  "Three more. What number should they press next?": "",
  "Two more. What number should they press next?": "",
  "Only one more... what number should they press next?": "",
  "Your crew member inputs the final digit, and the vault opens... inside of it, an inexplicable eldritch horror beyond description lays. You've unleashed an ancient evil on this reality... it looks at you, and then your crew, and says \"Look at this team, we're gonna do great!\" May God have mercy on your souls.": "",
  "Happy Holidays": "",
  "Blow it up!": "",
  "Leave it to its mumbling.": "",
  "The voice continues to talk incomprehensibly for a few moments; you think it mentions a vault, or something, but you don't really care. You've got more important things to be doing, like... nothing.": "",
  "You continue to loot, pilfer and plunder... That's gotta be enough, right?": "",
  "It's never enough!": "",
  "It is enough, actually.": "",
  "Again, you continue to pillage. You've been here for a while at this point... is that enough?": "",
  "I'LL say when it's enough!": "",
  "Yeah, I'm good. Almost lost myself for a second there...": "",
  "The beast doth bleed riches, indeed. A pittance, eclipsed by thy royal splendour... yet riches, even thus.": "",
  "Feast, o' pit in mine soul...": "",
  "You come to, hours later. The last thing you remember is... scrapping ships? The voice calls to you, \"We need... to get out of here, now, you fool! The Rebels... overtake us!\" Scorn coats every word, and you glance around, drunkenly... the remains of several Rebel ships lie outside in space already. How long have you been here? As if on cue, a small fleet of MFK Aces pull into the beacon; you figure it's high time to get out of here.": "",
  "You push yourself to keep scrapping in an attempt to sate your all-consuming avarice... but it's not enough. It's never enough. Nothing will ever, ever be enough. Have you been consumed by the void... or have you, yourself, become the void? The voice weighs in, \"It... would be best if we moved on, surely.\"": "",
  "Submit; become greed, incarnate.": "",
  "\"The... the rebels encroach. Is... this not a concern?\" The voice pleads with you. It pleads, and you don't listen; its words are but drops of silver in this sea of gold...": "",
  "Bask in the opulent radiance of it all.": "",
  "Hark! A foul leviathan, amidst your riches! A beast to be felled, lest its presence taint these sacred grounds... forth, brothers; spill and feast upon this abomination's gilded blood!": "",
  "Repent; become willpower, personified.": "",
  "The void, ever-present, greets you. Seems you're popular, because so does the voice: \"A field... of wrecks appears to surround this beacon. Valuable resources... should you trade time, the most valuable resource... of all.\"": "",
  "Wrecks... resources... scrap! Let me at it!": "",
  "You and your crew get to work, and you manage to scrap a fair few of the ships. Any more would be at the risk of the rebels catching up...": "",
  "Keep going. There's loot to be had!": "",
  "I'm good, wouldn't want to be too greedy.": "",
  "\"A... wise decision, indeed.\" That almost sounded like praise... Regardless, you prepare to leave the beacon with your newfound loot.": "",
  "Wouldn't want to disturb the dead. I'll pass.": "",
  "You imagine the voice raising its eyebrow in your head as it speaks to you, \"Truly? I... thought this sort of wisdom well past you. Consider me... humbled.\" A compliment? An insult? You're not sure why they've gotta be annoying about it, regardless.": "",
  "The dice vanish into the darkness, and you realize that you aren't actually sure what's supposed to happen. Your fears are quickly put to rest, however, as... a swarm of dice return from the void?

You overhear the Enlightened counting, in a fit, \"T-three... seven... fourteen... uh, thirty-eight... thirty-nine, blue... Dark One, be with me... thirty-seven... no! No, no, Dark One damn it, why?! Forty... red... you win. This... is my entire shipment... I'm... going to be banished for sure...\" They seem devastated.": "",
  "Woo-hoo! Big winner, that's me!": "",
  "The Enlightened sends your winnings over whilst sobbing. You didn't know that they could cry, either. The voice calls to you, \"A... strange game, but one I am... familiar with. The actual multiplication of the dice, itself, is... trivial.\" It doesn't elaborate, but it sounds like it had a good time. You think.": "",
  "Call off the bet.": "",
  "The Enlightened looks up from their sobbing fit on the floor to meet your gaze. \"T-... truly?\" You nod, and they attempt to compose themselves a little bit. It doesn't really work, but you appreciate the attempt. \"I... I cannot thank you enough, outsider... Were I able to make it up to you, I'd...\" They pause, and a look of realization overcomes their face. \"W-wait! Wait... one moment! I have something... just for you!\" They then cut communications, and you're left waiting for your surprise.": "",
  "Luckily, you don't have to wait long. The Enlightened hails a few moments later, both of their arms full of yellow lights, \"These lights... are our people's staple, a gift... from the Dark One. I see... no greater honor, than bestowing my own lights upon you. It must be... the least I can do; you have my... infinite gratitude for your infinite mercy.\" With that, they send the lights over. You were just being nice, and this guy's just shy of worshipping you over his own God... the voice calls to you, \"A strange game... with an even stranger outcome. You have... my thanks, as well. Life... is hard, for my people; and you recognized that they... needed the fuel more than you do. So, again... thank you.\" Your bet is returned to you, as well as a whole ship's worth of Enlightened lights to put up!": "",
  "The dice vanish into the darkness, and you realize that you aren't actually sure what's supposed to happen. Your fears are quickly put to rest, however, as... a swarm of dice return from the void? You overhear the Enlightened counting, in a fit, \"T-three... seven... fourteen... uh, thirty-eight... thirty-nine, blue... Dark One, be with me... thirty-seven... forty! Forty red! I... win, I actually win! Dark One, praise be!\" Uh, damn. Not really any sugarcoating this one... you just lost thirty fuel. The voice calls to you, \"A... strange game, but one I am... familiar with. The actual multiplication of the dice, itself, is... trivial.\" It doesn't elaborate, but it sounds like it had a good time. You think.": "",

  "You're about to do something when you receive a hail from the void... should you accept it?": "",
  "Eerie. Sure!": "",
  "You accept the hail, and you're face to face with an Enlightened Cultist, \"Outsider, care... to gamble?\" Before you can answer, the voice speaks to you, \"This... is a fuel-transport ship, belonging to the Enlightened. I... didn't consider it a threat, nor did I... consider that they'd bother you.\" The darkness is pulled back, and you see the ship for yourself. Now, what's this about gambling?": "",
  "What are we gambling, exactly?": "",
  "The Enlightened would roll its eyes if it had any. \"Fuel, were it not... obvious. We... each bid, and then toss dice... into the Dark One's embrace. Whoever... rolls highest when they return, wins.\"": "",
  "Sure, I'm up for it.": "",
  "\"Then make... your bet. I'll mirror it, unless... you've got more fuel than a vessel whose sole purpose... is transporting fuel?\"": "",
  "Bet low. [-3{]": "",
  "You send the fuel over, and the Enlightened, through an airlock, casts the dice into the ether. It asks you to call one of them; one's red, one's blue.": "",
  "Red.": "",
  "Blue.": "",
  "Bet middlingly. [-6{]": "",
  "Bet high. [-9{]": "",
  "Bet ridiculously high. [-30{]": "",
  "You send the fuel over, and you notice that the Enlightened is sweating bullets... you didn't realize that they could sweat. Regardless, through an airlock, they cast the dice into the ether. It asks you to call one of them; one's red, one's blue.": "",
  "On second thought, I don't really want to bet.": "",
  "\"Here I was... thinking things were about to get interesting.\" They cut communications, and you're left alone with its words. Are you boring? The voice provides no answers.": "",
  "Nah, I'm good.": "",
  "\"Wait, what? What's... there even to gai-\" You cut communications and fire upon the fuel-transport. Even in the vacuum of space, the fuel manages to pull oxygen from within the ship and briefly ignite... resulting in the ship being decimated, consumed by a blazing explosion. It's not likely that there's anything left to scrap... a pity, truly. The silence agrees.": "",
  "Eerie. Nope!": "",
  "With the call refused, all is quiet. You tell yourself that you prefer this complete, inescapable and deafening silence in an attempt to feel better. Somehow, that doesn't work.": "",
  "You're getting ready to do... nothing, when you receive a hail from the void. Should you accept it?": "",
  "Once you're done salvaging, the voice speaks to you, \"DISPARITY-17... a name which implies much, and says... little.\" It doesn't elaborate, and you're left wondering about said implications.": "",
  "(Disparity Crew) They must have been here looking for members of the Disparity.": "",
  "Indeed. Though misguided, this IS Dark God territory. Not the worst place in the universe to look... still, you have to wonder what they were hoping to accomplish by coming here.": "",
  "You're unsure...": "",
  "Alas, it seems that this must be a mystery for another day.": "",
  "The voice, for once, has a question for you, \"These strange... metal men. What do you... know of them?\"": "",
  "Depends. Which metal men?": "",
  "\"Your people... call them the Engi. My people... are quite closeted, one could say. We hear tell of... outsiders and their ways only through new kin, or tribute, arriving. These... Engi, in particular... we're quite unfamiliar with. Regardless, one of their... ships lies at this beacon, I believe.\" A mystery, even to the mysterious voice?": "",
  "Sounds interesting, let me see them.": "",
  "The darkness recedes, and you see an Engi ship; no mere one, either, but an elite. They hail you, \"Identity: Federation. Probability of encountering Federation in current location: approaching null... implies external motivation. Federation motivation requested.\" They want to know why you're here... what do they have to be suspicious of?": "",
  "Long story. Essentially, I've been chosen by the Deep Ones' 'Dark God' to be tribute. Just trying to escape the sector, now.": "",
  "It processes this briefly, \"Federation goal: escape. Engi goal: antithetical to Federation goal. Compromise proposed: Engi assists Federation; Federation assists Engi.\"": "",
  "What do you want me to do?": "",
  "\"Request: tell no one that you encountered Engi.\" It comes off as a demand rather than a request...": "",
  "Its body shifts slightly, \"Request: fulfilled. Engi directive: trust Federation and assist. Assistance required = unknown. Request updated: make assistance required known.\"": "",
  "They send a few drones over to repair your hull. Afterwards, they pick the call back up, \"Request: fulfilled. No further reason for communication.\" With that, they dive back into the void, and you're left about as curious as you started...": "",
  "They send a few nodes of fuel over. Afterwards, they pick the call back up, \"Request: fulfilled. No further reason for communication.\" With that, they dive back into the void, and you're left about as curious as you started...": "",
  "Request missiles.": "",
  "They send a few missiles over. You're not sure why the Engi even have missiles, but afterwards, they pick the call back up, \"Request: fulfilled. No further reason for communication.\" With that, they dive back into the void, and you're left about as curious as you started...": "",
  "Request drone parts.": "",
  "They send quite a few drone parts over, it seems they have them in surplus. Afterwards, they pick the call back up, \"Request: fulfilled. No further reason for communication.\" With that, they dive back into the void, and you're left about as curious as you started...": "",
  "(Harmony Crew) Request direct Harmony assistance.": "",
  "They glance at your Engi, \"Harmony unit detected. Request for Harmony assistance: deemed satisfactory. Dispatching additional Engi.\" With that, an Engi Defender is sent over, and the ship dives back into the void; you're left about as curious as you started...": "",
  "I can't promise that.": "",
  "The Engi's body stiffens, \"Failure to meet request will result in retaliation. Request restated: tell no one that you encountered Engi.\"": "",
  "Okay, yeah, I won't tell anyone.": "",
  "Its body rests, \"Request: fulfilled. Engi directive: trust Federation and assist. Assistance required = unknown. Request updated: make assistance required known.\"": "",
  "I'm sorry, I can't.": "",
  "\"Harmony infiltration of region DISPARITY-17 cannot be made known. Solution: destruction of Federation vessel.\" They cut communications, and their weapons come online!": "",
  "I think I'd rather just blow you up.": "",
  "\"Hostility: detected. Preparing self-defense protocol.\" The Engi turn away from you, but communications remain up momentarily, \"Request: reinforcements. Location: region DISPARITY-17, sub-region 198-B. Mission of crit-\" Communications are finally cut, and you prepare to begin your assault.": "",
  "I don't have to explain myself to you.": "",
  "\"Failure to meet request will result in retaliation. Request restated: Federation motivation.\"": "",
  "Fine, it's a long story. Essentially, I've been chosen by the Deep Ones' 'Dark God' to be tribute. Just trying to escape the sector, now.": "",
  "I won't succumb to your threats. Attack!": "",
  "Doesn't interest me.": "",
  "\"I find that... interesting, itself.\" The voice goes quiet. There's no way it's judging you for doing nothing right now... like, who doesn't love doing nothing?": "",
  "You try your best to scan whatever's out there, but your scanners just can't pierce the darkness. Unable to do anything, you're forced to twiddle your thumbs while some... thing, bangs on your hull. It's a rhythmic banging; two knocks, pause, one knock, pause, two knocks... and so forth. It doesn't stop by the time you leave the beacon.": "",
  "You're able to pierce the darkness and get to the bottom of this; the thing outside is... a Deep One? It's slamming its fists against the hull, either trying to get in, futilely, or to grab your attention... rather effectively. What should you do?": "",
  "Open an airlock.": "",
  "You're about to open the airlock, when the voice screams at you. \"For future... reference, warn me when you're about to let this... false darkness in! I cannot save you... should it overtake your ship. You're... lucky I'm paying attention.\" You watch as the void outside recedes, and then finally get to open the airlock... now you just have to wait for the Deep One to enter.": "",
  "As expected, it doesn't take long, and you can hear it gasping for air as you close the airlock behind it... how long has it been holding its breath? Now that you can get a good look at it, you realize this isn't just any Deep One, but an Enlightened Cultist.": "",
  "Explain yourself!": "",
  "It speaks in-between deep, hearty breaths \"How far I've fallen, to... have to explain myself to an... outsider. Still, fallen far I... have. My kin have banished me for... 'heresy,' they claim. A crime punishable by... death.\" The voice chimes in, \"A punishment I know all... too well.\" The Enlightened continues, \"Regardless of the circumstances surrounding my... crime, they saw it fit to... leave me in the void, and let the Dark One... deal with me. That is... until you came along.\" It gives you a curt bow, which would feel nice were it not still gasping for air.": "",
  "You okay?": "",
  "It chuckles at that, and says \"I will be soon... thanks to you. You have my deepest... gratitude. My kin may have... abandoned me, but I don't believe the Dark One has. No, I believe He must... have sent you. As such, and seeing that I have... nowhere else to go, I see no greater... honor than working aboard your ship. May His eternal night... darken our path.\" A real 180 from calling you an outsider... still, you'll never turn down having extra hands on deck. Even if they're volatile, space-tearing hands.": "",
  "It looks up at you and screams, \"For the Dark One!\" Then... nothing, it just kind of... stares at you. There's not much it can do, but you can't really get rid of it, either; lest you incur the Dark God's wrath. The voice speaks to you, \"I... apologize for my kin. Know... your efforts to save them don't go unappreciated.\" If nobody else has your back, you know the ominous, secretive voice has your back. You think.": "",
  "A foreboding presence overwhelms you at this beacon... as well as a sense of déjà vu. The voice calls to you, \"You... are not alone at this beacon. Nor... is there a ship here. Curious, is it... not?\" What's that supposed to mean?": "",
  "You quickly turn around, but there's... nothing there. Just then, though, you hear something bang against the hull of the ship.": "",
  "Investigate.": "",
  "Even if you were to send someone out, they can't see an inch in front of them in this void, and the voice doesn't seem interested in helping. You'll have to rely on your sensors here.": "",
  "Wait, we don't have sensors...": "",
  "Unable to do anything, you're forced to twiddle your thumbs while some... thing, bangs on your hull. It's a rhythmic banging; two knocks, pause, one knock, pause, two knocks... and so forth. It doesn't stop by the time you leave the beacon.": "",
  "Run a scan.": "",
  "(Deep One Cultist) \"Granted... sight, by the Dark One...\"": "",
  "(Slug Crew) \"Darknessss, sssshmarknessss.\"": "",
  "(Telepathic Shell) \"Void, more like... shmoid. Hah.\"": "",
  "Nope, staying right here.": "",
  "Unwilling to do anything, you're forced to twiddle your thumbs while some... thing, bangs on your hull. It's a rhythmic banging; two knocks, pause, one knock, pause, two knocks... and so forth. It doesn't stop by the time you leave the beacon.": "",
  "The employee holds up a screen with its wares on it against the camera.": "",
  "Purchase a Modular Weapon.": "",
  "\"Thank you for your purchasssse.\"": "",
  "Purchase a Module.": "",
  "Actually, nevermind.": "",
  "Alright, I'm good.": "",
  "The Slug looks unphased, \"Wow, you, uh, bought all my sssstock. Forty-sssseven more buy-outssss like that and I'll meet my quota for the week. Ssssuposssse I gotta wait for my next sssshipment.\" You have a feeling that that shipment isn't going to be arriving any time soon... still, his stock of magically transforming weapons and modules was pretty cool.": "",
  "Arriving at the beacon, you're surprised to see that you've been hailed. Someone sees you through the darkness... and the voice provides no answers.": "",
  "Accept the mysterious hail.": "",
  "You accept the hail and... are bombarded by ads? \"Ssssave 1.2% off on all Hektar Industries(TM) productssss for the nexxxxt 0.3 sssseconds!\" and \"You won't BELIEVE the dealssss in your area! They likely won't exxxxpire for SSSSECONDSSSS! No guarantee.\" among many others. Why do Slugs slur the s's in their writing, too? After the barrage of ads calms down, you get to speak to an actual person... if you can consider Hektar employees people, \"Ssssup. What're the Fedssss doing out here?\"": "",
  "What are YOU doing out here?": "",
  "\"Uh? You didn't get the company memo? Exxxxpanding and all that, find the nearesssst nebula to sssset up sssshop in. Real pretty one, too, but the cusssstomerssss have been pretty, like... nonexxxxisssstent? You'd be the firsssst one, sssshould you, uh, sssshop. You sssshould.\"": "",
  "You realize this isn't a nebula, right?": "",
  "You imagine it'd be blinking a few times if it could, the way it stands there not answering... then, \"Like, uh, what do you mean? What issss it, then?\"": "",
  "It's an infinite void of darkness perpetuated by a cruel, uncaring God for the sole purpose of our eternal torment.": "",
  "It takes a few moments to process this, before eventually answering, \"Sssso... issss that, like, outsssside Hektar Industries(TM) jurissssdicttttion?\"": "",
  "Uh, maybe?": "",
  "\"If not, I kinda have to do my job here. Otherwisssse, I'm like, free or whatever; but I'm not taking any chancessss. Unlessss you're here to get Billy himsssself on the phone and pardon me, then I'd prefer you either sssshop or leave. Preferably, uh, sssshop. Sssseems I might misssss my quota at thissss rate...\" Alas, another Slug lost to the wage-slave-trade.": "",
  "Sure, I'll shop I guess.": "",
  "(Mind Control) Ooooooo, I am Billy, and I hereby pardon yoooooou!": "",
  "Again, you have to imagine that it'd be staring at you blinking, \"You know that, like, doessssn't work on me, right? You tryna buy ssssomething or not?\"": "",
  "Okay, fine...": "",
  "I'm good, sorry.": "",
  "\"Then why are we, uhh... talking?\" You're not really sure yourself, and you end communications. Aren't there, like, bloodthirsty hunters all throughout this void? How's this Slug just sitting here wasting oxygen?": "",
  "(Billy) \"Ooooooo, I am Billy, and I hereby pardon yoooooou!\"": "",
  "The Slug falls out of its chair, backwards, and onto the floor. Before it's even gotten up, it yells from the floor, \"Misssster Billy, ssssir! Are you ssssure, ssssir?\" Billy, looking a bit ashamed, nods curtly. The Slug gets up and does a little, weird Slug dance, \"Woo-hoo! I'm free! Yo, Fed guy, take all my sssstock, there'ssss no way I'll be needing it anymore! I'm acttttually free! Here, I'll, uh, like, eject them into sssspace for you, I guesssss!\" You hear a sound over the hail, but... the void's still blocking your vision.": "",
  "Hey, voice? Any help?": "",
  "After a few moments, it answers, \"Sorry... I, too, had fallen out of my chair. Only... from laughter. Anyways, yes, I shall... force this false darkness to abate.\" The darkness does just that, and you can see a Hektar weapon, and a few modules, floating in space... but not the ship. You notice the hail's ended, too. Guess that guy's out of here.": "",
  "Gather the Hektar gear.": "",
  "You pick up the weapon...": "",
  "...and a module...": "",
  "...and another module! Looks like that's everything.": "",
  "(Billy) \"Hi, yessss, Billy here... I'm not on the phone, but you're free to go.\"": "",
  "I'll pass.": "",
  "Shopping? I love shopping!": "",
  "Too mysterious for me. Deny it.": "",
  "You know better than to accept hails from the void. Content, you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Something feels weird, here... even disregarding the swirling, all-consuming sea of shadows outside. It's just a feeling you have.": "",
  "It's probably nothing... right?": "",
  "The clangorous sound emanating from within your ship's hold sure doesn't sound like nothing. You get up to investigate, and your crew follow suit. Awaiting you there, is... a pile of scrap? Before you can wonder as to its origin, the voice speaks, \"Foul... temptations befitting a foul God. Reject this... pity. It toys with you.\" It's free scrap, though...": "",
  "Accept this gift.": "",
  "Who cares if it's a God's pity? Scrap is scrap! The voice doesn't comment, but, honestly, who cares? It can pout all it wants while you're out here rolling in scrap.": "",
  "Deny this omen.": "",
  "Renegades make their own fate; you throw the scrap outside and the voice calls to you, approvingly, \"And so... the False God weeps. I respect... your fortitude.\"": "",
  "After defeating the Enlightened, you turn to find that the Clansmen have vanished. Unsure if they've fled the beacon or simply retreated back into the void, you're left alone with the silence.": "",
  "After defeating the Enlightened, one of the Clansmen hails you, \"Well, well, well. Going fisssshing assss well, eh, Federattttion? Count me in, I like the cut of your jib.\" They turn away, \"Guyssss, I'm heading ou-\" Comms are cut, but, guess you've got a new crew member! The silence is in awe, as well.": "",
  "You've triumphed against the Clansmen, but it looks like the Enlightened fled during the battle... still, you've done the right thing and protected the weak. Or, er, the weaker? They're still out here, like, hunting people...": "",
  "You've triumphed against the Clansmen, and one the Enlightened hails you, \"Outsiders... risking themselves, to save us? A sign... from the Dark One, surely, praise be to his name. If... He wills it, then let it be so.\" You aren't really sure what they're talking about, for a moment, and then they teleport behind you! A new crew member, and a heart attack... the two-for-one special.": "",
  "Arriving at the distress beacon, the voice calls to you, \"Kin... require assistance, here; the hunters have become the... hunted. A Slug ship assaults them, abusing their ability... to see through this false darkness. Shall... you assist?\"": "",
  "Part the void, I'll take care of this.": "",
  "The void is pushed back, and the two ships come into view. The Enlightened have taken a beating, but they're still standing... and you notice that these are no ordinary Slugs, but Clansmen; they must be out to hunt Deep Ones in this territory.": "",
  "You get in-between the two ships and aim your weapons at the Clansmen, making your intentions clear. Prepare for battle!": "",
  "Attack the Enlightened.": "",
  "They're vulnerable! Getting in-between the two ships, you aim your weapons at the Enlightened, and the Clansmen don't seem to particularly mind you stealing their mark. The Enlightened prepare to defend themselves!": "",
  "I can't afford to take this fight, I'm sorry.": "",
  "\"I... am sorry, as well. Were there... anything I could do to save them...\" It can't be easy, being hunted by the very people you're dedicated to saving... wait. That kind of describes you, doesn't it?": "",
  "Little time is given before the voice, panicked, speaks, \"A hunter... lies here, this distress signal was a trap!\" Rapidly, the void is pulled back, and it's just in time for you to dodge the incoming fire... prepare for battle!": "",
  "You've just finished salvaging when the voice speaks to you, \"I'm... happy to see that wretch be silenced. To... experiment on my kin, for the sole purpose of furthering... its own, apathetic mind. May the ruthlessness of its damnation... mirror its own.\" Amen.": "",
  "Your Deep One heads into the station, and you wait.": "",
  "Eventually, the Shell returns... alone. \"Thhhhe test... I'm sorry to report, thhhat... your Deep one...\" It's choking on its words, struggling to speak.": "",
  "These things happen, I understand.": "",
  "It looks up, \"Nahhhh, I'm just pulling your leg. Thhhhey're fine. Here, I'll go get 'em.\" What kind of...?": "",
  "Wait, again.": "",
  "This time, you don't have to wait long. The Shell returns with your Deep One in tow, and it hands you some scrap; \"Here, for your troubles. I know you Fed types love your trash.\" Oh, really? Was it the doctorate that tipped you off to that one? Still, though... it's a lot of scrap... it's hard to stay mad.": "",
  "You bastard, I'll kill you!": "",
  "It backs up and shouts, \"Woah, woah, woah, I'm just pulling your leg! Thhhhey're fine! Here, I'll go get 'em!\" What kind of...?": "",
  "Eventually, the Shell returns... alone. \"I'll be blunt... complete screw-up. Thhhey're dead. I am capable of compensating you, however; science is nothhhhing if not about being prepared.\" It turns to gather the compensation, and the voice calls to you, outraged, \"This... this... MURDERER... has intruded on our lands. Led... my kin into its den of lies. Lines... their graves with silver. I... make few, requests, outsider... its damnation is one of them. Be the judge, jury... and executioner.\"": "",
  "The Shell turns back to you, with compensation in hand, \"I hope we can move past thhhhis, truly. If it's any consolation... thhhhey died in the name of science.\"": "",
  "Take the compensation and leave.": "",
  "The Shell offers little in the way of empathy, but you take the compensation and leave the station. The bag of scrap clinks and clangs obnoxiously as you drag it along, but the silence that ensues is louder yet.": "",
  "You arrive back on your ship to the sight of your Deep One being perfectly fine due to your Clonebay... seems you totally ripped that Shell off!": "",
  "And... what science is that, exactly?": "",
  "The Shell tugs at its tie, \"Well, uh, I'm here in Deep One territory studying the strange, eh, 'gas,' you could call it, thhhhat completely smothhhhers thhhis region.\" Its gaze briefly darts around the room.": "",
  "And... what have you discovered, doctor?": "",
  "Panic overtakes the pitiful thing. \"Thhhhe, um... thhhhe... 'gas,' it defies explanation. It's... phhhhysical, thhhhat's for sure; it can be destroyed, and manipulated. What stumps us, thhhhough, is its... intelligence. Whethhhher real, or anthhhhropomorphhhhized, it appears to abide by some form of logic, or, um, thhhhought process. Thhhhat, and we can't figure out its origin, or its purpose, for thhhhat matter...\" It keeps rambling on. Does it think you're listening?": "",
  "Shoot it.": "",
  "The gunshot rings throughout the station, and the Shell drops dead; shot mid-sentence. Good riddance.": "",
  "Take the 'compensation,' and leave.": "",
  "Gods, that was satisfying... with your scrap in hand, you make a mental note to prepare a tribute speech for your fallen Deep One as you return to your ship. After everything's calmed down, the voice briefly speaks to you, \"I... too, am satisfied.\"": "",
  "Burn this place, and its blood money, to the ground.": "",
  "It doesn't take much to set the entire station ablaze... the whole place reeks of chemicals. As it burns, you breathe it all in... and you embody vengeance. Wrath, given form, and yet... you slow down, and take a deep breath. It's over, you've won. You can leave this accursed place and its evil memory behind; its condemnation made complete through your righteous fury and flame. As the proof of your vengenace licks at your face, a mass forms within its blazing heart. You watch as it's molded, and takes a familiar shape... it's... your Deep One? Is this an illusion? A trick of the smoke? A hallucination? As if to answer, the mass rises from the flames and walks right past you; it's completely unharmed. You find yourself unable to move as you stare in awe, and the fire, now eating at you, welcomes you into its ravenous embrace... And, you...": "",
  "I...": "",
  "You wake up. You're sitting in the station, and all is still. When did you doze off?": "",
  "Go back to waiting.": "",
  "You don't have to wait long. The Shell returns with your Deep One in tow, and it hands you some scrap; \"Hhhhere, for your troubles. I know you Fed types love your trashhhh.\" Oh, really? Was it the doctorate that tipped you off to that one? Still, though... it's a lot of scrap... it's hard to stay mad.": "",
  "You arrive at the distress beacon, and the voice, annoyed, speaks to you, \"There... is no emergency here. One of the... science-things, Shells, you call them, seeks attention. Shall... you grant it?\"": "",
  "Sure, I love Shells!": "",
  "As the void recedes, you expect to see a ship, yet there's an entire Shell station built here! They hail, \"Federation, here? How... perplexing. Not quite what I had in mind, thhhhough, with thhhe distress beacon. Still, you wouldn't happen to have any Deep Ones onboard, would you? Or perhaps some of thhhheir more... exotic weaponry?

  "Why do you ask...?": "",
  "You get the feeling that it tries to rolls its eye, \"I need thhhhem for science, of course; what else? Do you have somethhhhing or not? Othhhherwise, you're just wasting my time.\" Impatient, this one...": "",
  "(Deep One) Sure, yeah.": "",
  "(Darkness Weaponry) Sure, yeah.": "",
  "It seems elated at the sight of it, \"Strange tech, with even stranger origins, should the Deep Ones be believed.

Thhhhey appear to harness a gas similar, if not identical, to thhhhat of thhhhis region; furthhhher, said gas seems to have a mind of its own...\" it pauses, perhaps realizing it's rambling, and then clears its throat before continuing, \"Allow me a moment to study what I can; I'll keep it brief.\"": "",
  "Wait for the Shell to finish.": "",
  "Apparently, it did manage to keep it brief, as it returns only moments later, \"My hypothhhhesis appears to be correct; thhhhe gas withhhhin thhhhese weapons and thhhhe gas thhhhat makes up thhhhis region are indeed one and thhhhe same. I was able to cross-check my findings withhh thhhhat of my previous tests, involving anothhhher weapon I managed to get my hands on.

  "Thanks, science!": "",
  "As you look over the unusual weapon, the voice speaks to you, \"These... weapons, from the False God... why do you desire them?\"": "",
  "They make me feel powerful.": "",
  "\"Power... corrupts. The False God knows this, and offers power... where it finds value most. Remember this.\" The voice then goes quiet, and you're left alone with the weapon... the power... once more.": "",
  "I kinda just keep finding them.": "",
  "\"It... is no coincidence, the False God desires you... you, and your devotion. These gifts... are meant to corrupt; ensure... that they do not.\" The voice then goes quiet, and you're left alone with the weapon... the mystery... once more.": "",
  "They're fun!": "",
  "\"To find fun, in... the eradication of your enemies. A good quality... for a soldier to have, yet a terrible one... for a person. Still, at least... you're honest.\" The voice then goes quiet, and you're left alone with the weapon... the fun... once more.": "",
  "(Soulplague Weaponry) Does this work?": "",
  "You hand your Soulplague-infected weapon over to the Shell, and they look at it, perplexed, \"No, why would thhhhis work? Thhhhis is just an ordinary weapon, infected by... thhhhe Soulplague... matter... virus... Ughhh...\" As they touch it, they seem to... mutate, and turn iridescent, before just sitting around and moaning.

  "I'nft'in": "",
  "I'll pass, thanks.": "",

  "It looks alarmed, \"Wait, what are you doing? You can't be serious, can you...?\" There's nowhere it can run.": "",
  "Are you kidding me? I hate Shells.": "",
  "The voice snickers, \"As... do I.\" Perhaps the two of you have more in common than you thought! At the very least, you have one thing in common.": "",
  "You pray, but nobody listens. You're forced to cower in fear as the shadows beat against your hull.": "",
  "Cower.": "",
  "The shadows, ravenous, keep up their assault...": "",
  "...until, eventually...": "",
  "...the storm wanes. Suddenly, and inexplicably, all is quiet.": "",
  "You feel as if reality itself stands with you, and as you overcome the darkness, infinite amounts of strikes against the hull can be heard. Scrapes, scratches, breaks... are these the sounds of desperation? Has this forsaken abyss no shame? With one final oorah, you push against the darkness... and all goes quiet.": "",
  "Did... did we do it? Have we won?": "",
  "No answer rings out, and yet... you feel blessed, somehow. You watch as your hull regenerates before your very eyes... what exactly have you just been through?": "",
  "No answer rings out. Still, somehow, you watch as your hull mends some of its wounds before your very eyes... what exactly have you just been through?": "",
  "No answer rings out, and you're left alone with the silence.": "",
  "The silence is deafening. Foreboding, even, as moments later one last strike is made against your hull! The damage seems minimal, but... it concerns you that the shadows are capable of acts of cowardice.": "",
  "You're at the distress beacon, but... the voice is silent.": "",
  "Was it a false alarm?": "",
  "Ah, it hits you. You're the one in distress.": "",
  "Drown...": "",

  "...in...": "",
  "...who will come to save you?": "",

  "A screeching sound overtakes you... that of metal, on metal? Or, rather, metal being torn... you're not sure. You're gathering yourself when the voice, distant, calls to you, \"Outsider!

  "My... hull?": "",
  "You realize where you are, and what's happening. Something's breaking through the hull; you're unsure what, but the voice suggests it's the darkness itself. If that's true... what hope do you have of escaping the void?": "",

  "With the strange duo defeated, you search their wreckage for anything interesting... unfortunately, your search doesn't come up with anything. Nothing but silence remains.": "",
  "There are a few moments of silence as you wait for the voice to speak. You're beginning to assume there must be nothing here when, finally, it does, \"This... is most peculiar. One of my kin... shares a vessel with a human. Shall... you meet with them?\"": "",
  "Sure, let's see what they're up to.": "",
  "The void parts, and you're met with the visage of a civillian ship of all things. They hail, and you find that it is indeed a human and Enlightened Cultist on the other end. The human, muscular and well-built, speaks, \"Hoho! Federation, a Renegade no less! Are you here seeking the truths of this place, as well?\"": "",
  "Something like that.": "",
  "He crosses his arms and gives a hearty laugh, \"Well, you're too late, friend! I do believe me and my beloved have just come across the greatest secret of all...\" he gestures to the Enlightened Cultist, who shifts shyly and giggles, \"Mmm... indeed. The well-kept secret among my kin... that is forbidden love! Who would have... known that outsiders could be so romantic...\" They embrace, and you're left feeling a bit awkward.": "",
  "Remain silent.": "",
  "The man breaks the embrace to turn back to you, \"In any case, well met! The name's Kyr: the greatest explorer to ever grace this damnable Multiverse!\" You can't say you've heard of him... Kyr continues, \"And, with me is Lilith... my bride to be, and the most beautiful maiden I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.\" You've never seen a Deep One blush, but Lilith manages to do so nonetheless.": "",
  "Well met! I'm something of an explorer myself...": "",
  "Kyr exaggerates an eyebrow raise, \"Oho? Truly?\" He rubs his burly beard for a moment, \"Well, from one avid explorer to another, I have reason to believe that there's a secret to this place. Past this void lies another plane, one deeper... darker. My beloved, too, has heard tell of it.\" He gestures to Lilith again, who raises her head to speak, \"I've... overheard the Elders speaking of it. The realm... where our tribute is taken, and gifts... are sent in return. The realm... where the Dark One lies.\"": "",
  "Curious. Do you intend to find it?": "",
  "\"Hah! I wouldn't be able to call myself the greatest explorer if I didn't!\" Kyr strikes a noble pose as he once again performs a hefty belly laugh, but then his demeanor shifts and he gets closer to the screen, just slightly, \"I don't know what awaits us on the other side, or, truthfully, if we'll ever be able to return. If you ever intend to search for us...\" he pauses, typing something, and you hear a small beep as your ship receives a detailed FTL signature, \"...you'll know how to find us, if we're still alive.\" Kyr sits up, his face lightening once more, \"Not that I can seriously suggest following us to such a hellish place! Just, if you DO happen to follow the call of the true explorer and find yourself in the Dark God's neighborhood. Besides, we're not even entirely certain it actually exists!\" Kyr laughs once more, but Lilith seems slightly disturbed.": "",
  "I'll keep that in mind. Good luck, Kyr. You too, Lilith!": "",
  "Lilith's face brightens as you acknowledge her, \"Thank you... uh, Federation, was it, dear?\" Kyr nods enthusiastically, \"Indeed! One of the few noble factions left in the entire Multiverse. There's nobody greater to trust with our location, my love.\" This appears to comfort Lilith somewhat. The two bid you farewell, and you're left alone with the darkness as they jump out of the beacon. That is, you're left with not only the darkness, but also the voice, who speaks, \"How... charming. I... wish them well.\" You do, too.": "",
  "Nah, I'm just here for scrap. Attack the couple!": "",
  "The man's brow furrows, \"Hah! Here I was thinking the Federation to be a respectable association. Worry not, my dear, I'll get us out of here!\" You detect their engines roar to life, they're trying to make a getaway!": "",
  "Lilith looks at you.": "",
  "She seems intent on not having to see whatever's here... willing to appease her, you tell the voice you're uninterested. It sighs, \"Suit... yourself...\" and goes quiet. You're left alone with the darkness.": "",
  "Not really interested...": "",
  "The voice, who seemed interested, sighs, \"Suit... yourself.\" It goes quiet, and you're left alone with the darkness.": "",
  "The Elite Federation ship crumbles, and you're lefting praying that the horrors left onboard have died with it...": "",
  "The Elite Federation ship lies empty - of horrors, and people alike - and you're left praying that that's truly the end of them...": "",
  "You're hardly given any time to reflect on what you just witnessed, though, before something within the Federation ship's wreckage catches your eye. No, it doesn't just merely catch your attention - you feel completely enraptured by the resplendent glow of whatever this thing is. Its allure draws you to focus your gaze, and make out its form...": "",
  "It's... beautiful.": "",
  "That wonderful, crystalline shard, from within the officer's coat... it's there, amongst the rubble. Calling to you. Beckoning you forth, into its embrace.": "",
  "Yes, I've... I've never needed anything else.": "",
  "You stare into the shard's ethereal center, losing yourself entirely to its overwhelming splendor, and everything else seems to fade away around you...": "",
  "The air smells of ash, and sulfur.": "",
  "Hah! Ain't it always? Ya used to hidin' roses in that armor of yours, or somethin'?": "",
  "Hardly. It's just... it doesn't have to be this way, you know? It's certainly not the way I would've envisioned things.": "",
  "Well, it's the way these things played out, ain't it? No use in cursin' the past. Or in cursin' past lives, to be frank.": "",
  "And, you're... what? Happy? Satisfied with the \"way these things played out?\" This doesn't just FEEL like hell, to me, Four - it IS my hell. And it'd be yours too, if she hadn't...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t...ugh, I'm sorry. I know you don't want this life any more than I do. I... I just wish we didn't feel so helpless, here.": "",
  "Who's sayin' we're helpless? What's the big guy gonna do, kill us? Bastard thing already knows it can't. S'only a matter of time before ya figure somethin' out, Ev.": "",
  "Obviously it can't kill us, but... there are worse hells than this one, Four. I mean, look at Six - she may enjoy fighting, but for all eternity? Because she felt discontent, and dared to do something about it? Even if her willpower never gives out, what about her armor? Or her body?": "",
  "She's a tough'un, Ev. Ya know that, don'tcha? N'it's not like we're sittin' here, twiddlin' our thumbs, waitin' for the day she kicks the bucket. We'll make it outta here, n'get Six outta her own mess. S'all the same, ain't it?": "",
  "Right. It's all the same. I'll... I'll figure something out, and... we'll...": "",
  "In an instant, your mind is torn away from this unfamiliar conversation, and a flashing series of visions overwhelms you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou see a Crystal, commanding some unseen force from within a sea of frozen flames.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThen, an Engi, tearing itself apart - searching for an unfound peace, deep within itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd, finally... a golden sigil.

  "Suffer in the agony of the moment.": "",
  "\"Oh... did you hit your head, funny one?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou open your eyes, screaming, and the masked Deep One standing over you flinches slightly. \"Then, the Dark One... did not get your tongue. You'd be... less funny without it, you know?\"": "",
  "What the hell was that? Who the HELL are you?": "",
  "A familiar laughter reverberates throughout the room, and your heart skips a beat. This must be the voice you've been talking to. The one who led you here, to this ship... to that shard of agony and lies.": "",
  "Did you... did you know that that would happen? With that damned shard? Where even is it?": "",
  "Though you can't read their expression from behind their mask, the Deep One tilts their head in an exaggerated fashion. \"Oh... no, really. I can't say I... know what you're talking about, either. Maybe you... did hit your head, after all? THAT... would be funny, I feel.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndeed, you look past the Deep One and towards the wreckage of the Federation ship outside, and the strange, resplendent light is gone. The void outside has gone entirely dark, once more.": "",
  "I... I see. Maybe I'm just going a little stir-crazy, out here.": "",
  "\"Oh... well, you'd better not get TOO crazy, on me... funny one. Being funny is one thing, but... crazy? I could never... work for a crazy one. THAT... would not be funny, would it?\"": "",
  "Yeah, that makes sense... wait, what?": "",
  "The laughter around you turns uproarious, and the masked Deep One bows, \"Oh... don't let me forget to introduce myself. An... Elder of the Enlightened, humbly at... your service, o' funniest one. I... am a Tributeshaper, as my people call it. You helped me... retrieve my beloved mask back from that crazed, thieving loon, and... well, I'm not one to leave my debts unpaid.\"": "",
  "Jester": "",
  "Then, that mask... THAT'S what we came here for? What even is it?": "",
  "The Tributeshaper puts a hand to their chin, charading deep thought, before pointing a single, clawed finger in the air. \"Oh... I know just how to explain this. Imagine being... a good person, funny one. And when you were... good enough, your deity of wonderful things, and joyfulness... rewards you, with an object made of pure, happy thoughts.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou nod your head, following along, and the patronizing Deep One moves its finger to point at its mask, \"Now, imagine that... but for whatever the hell the Dark One is. It... gives us, the Elders of our kind, these masks - Tribute Masks... as they're called. Most of the Enlightened... would find its bestowment to be the greatest honor imaginable, but... I'm a bit more cynical. Things... are funnier, that way.\"": "",
  "Alright, I guess. Why's it so important to you, if you aren't particularly into the whole all-powerful deity thing?": "",
  "There's a slight giggling from around the room, as the Tributeshaper rolls their head back, \"Oh... well, it's not just a badge of honor. It also... acts as a focus, for the manipulation of human souls.\"": "",
  "What?": "",
  "With a snap from their fingers, a floating, ephemeral figure appears beside you...": "",
  "Scream in abject terror.": "",
  "...and then, with another snap, a second, similar figure. You fall backwards, startled and screaming, and the giggling around you quickly devolves into a mocking cacophony once more. \"Oh... don't act too surprised, funny one. Unless you're... trying to be funny? Oh, that's... clever. You're a clever one, funny one.\" You give a look of confusion - and annoyance - and the Tributeshaper merely walks out of the room, whilst cackling... their entourage of souls floating just behind them.": "",
  "I... need a drink, sometime.": "",
  "You really do, you figure. This has been... quite the mess. From the mockery of the Tributeshaper, to the horrors aboard the Federation ship, and then the visions from that mysterious shard... you feel like you can still see that golden sigil, plain as day. Though, there is a silver lining - things are calm now, and you've made a powerful ally.": "",
  "Enjoy the peace and quiet.": "",
  "Your relaxation is immediately cut short by the sounds of yelling, as the - much less grating - voice that's accompanied you since the start of the sector butts in, \"Outsider! Outsider! Are... you okay? What happened? I... I could not see you, for quite some time. I've been fearing... the worst.\"": "",

  "Yeah, that's cute. I like my mask better, though.": "",

  "Nope, thankfully.": "",
  "\"Oh... then, it's all the same, isn't it? Allow me to... gather my souls, and we can head off.\" The Tributeshaper snaps its fingers, and an Unstable Soul appears...": "",

  "\"Oh... that's a pity, then. Hopefully I can still be of some... service to you, funny one. Allow me to at least... gather my souls, and we can head off.\" The Tributeshaper snaps its fingers, and an Unstable Soul appears...": "",
  "An unease, only made somewhat more bearable by your newfound familiarity with it, sits in the air as you wait for the voice to guide you. To your dismay, though... it never comes. There must be nothing of note here.": "",
  "You barely move an inch, before a shrill cackling breaks out around you, out of nowhere. You turn around, expecting to find its source, but there's nothing there, either. The laughter then grows louder, and louder, as if amused by the attempt - before, finally, quieting. You're left standing there, anxious and on your guard, when a new, unfamiliar voice makes its presence known to you:\n\t\n\t\"Oh... YOU'RE a funny one, aren't you? Turn... around again, it'll work this time! I swear it... I swear!\"\n\t\n\tThis is definitely a different voice than the one you've been talking to. It's much more high-pitched - almost annoyingly so - and clearly taking pleasure in your confusion.": "",
  "Remain stalwart.": "",
  "There's an audible growling echoing around the room, now - you realize that the laughter hadn't come from within your head, either. Whatever the source of these sounds is, they're different from the voices - now plural - that have been speaking to you.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith a sense of disappointment seeming to tinge its words, the shrill voice returns to its rambling within your mind, \"Oh... perhaps I was mistaken. Perhaps you're just like... the rest of them. Is joy... lost, on you lost souls?\"": "",
  "I'm... not lost, really. I have a guide.": "",
  "\"Oh... really? The one they brand... a traitor, you mean? Hmmm... I can't say I see them around here, anywhere. Do you... think they got bored? Left you to... die, maybe?\" There's a pause, as the growling around you shifts back to its prior, roaring laughter, and then the voice continues, \"THAT... would be funny, no? Maybe... you're not so boring, after all.\"": "",
  "Listen - I'm dealing with a lot right now. Speak clearly, or I'm taking my ship and jumping out of here.": "",
  "Turn around again.": "",
  "You do so, and find nothing once more. The laughter then - agonizingly - grows in volume, as if in response, and you realize that it's not coming from inside your head at all. Whatever the source of it IS, it's different from the voices - now plural - that have been speaking to you.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith complete glee coating its words, the shrill voice returns to its rambling within your mind, \"Oh... wow, you ARE a funny one!

  "\"Oh... really? The one they brand... a traitor, you mean? Hmmm... I can't say I see them around here, anywhere. Do you... think they got bored?

I knew I liked you.\"": "",
  "The laughter goes silent. \"Oh... do you think you could? You're welcome... to try, you know.\" You eye your ship's controls in response, but something inside you causes you to then hesitate. Anxiety? Fear? Something... more foreign, entirely?\n\t\n\tWhatever the case is, it feels beyond your control, and the cackling returns - alongside the voice. \"Oh, tribute-thing... if I had intended to kill you, you would've been... helpless to stop me, don't you know?

  "Silently pray that this weirdo really IS smitten down.": "",
  "Unfortunately, rather than the sound of blessed thunder, you're merely graced with more of that grating giggling. \"Oh... that's funny, too. I must be right, then. You're... not here as tribute.

  "Hesitantly agree. You've got time to spare.": "",
  "There's an uproar amongst the laughter around you, as the voice itself gets giddy, \"Oh... wonderful. Funny, special... AND wonderful! The Dark One really... knows how to pick them, doesn't it? In that case, then... shift your course a little to the left, and just... fly that way, for a while. Don't worry about... bumping into anything. I'll be... watching closely! Wouldn't want you... crashing into something, and dying horribly. THAT would be funny, but... if I've learned anything over the years, it's that... it's not always about being funny. It usually is, but... not always.\" The voice, along with the now maddening laughter, both vanish - leaving you with naught but eerie silence once more.": "",
  "Here we go, then...": "",
  "You follow the voice's vague instructions to the best of your ability, and simply fly straight ahead in one direction. It's rather uneventful, for a while - until, at one point, it randomly screams within your mind for you to steer hard to the left. You jump to do so, and the echoing laughter roars back to life around you for a miserable, few seconds. You... aren't particularly enjoying this ride.": "",
  "Eventually, though... the darkness around you seems to part itself, and you're face to face with none other than an Elite Federation ship. What are they doing here? No, more importantly - what are YOU doing here...? What's being expected of you, exactly? You hadn't really thought about asking that until now.": "",
  "Hey, uh... voice guy? Care to explain?": "",
  "It seems startled that you asked, almost as if it were expecting you to blindly act. \"Oh... well, of course. I mentioned other lost souls... earlier, yes? This ones seems special, too. Though... not quite as funny. He thought it... prudent to steal something valuable from me. I... want it back.\"": "",
  "If you can destroy me so easily, then why can't you just destroy them? Aren't they \"eyeless\" out here, too?": "",
  "\"Oh... you ask a lot of questions. Questions aren't so... funny, but... truthfully, this one scares me. Somewhat. Something... is, in fact, guiding him - though, I can't tell what. I tried asking, but... well, he wasn't as open as I'm being, was he?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou glance at the Federation ship outside, and then back to your ship's console, and realize that they've sent a request to hail while you've been chatting it up. The voice briefly interjects, before bowing out again, \"I... just want what's mine. I don't care... how you get it. Unless it's funny. THAT... would be fun, yes?\"": "",
  "Take a deep breath, and answer the Federation ship's hail.": "",
  "Well, whatever. I'll figure it out. Hail the Federation ship.": "",
  "Decline. You've had enough of this.": "",
  "There's a booing in the air around you, as the voice doesn't hesitate to express its disappointment, \"Oh... suppose you weren't funny, after all. Maybe I'm... the real clown, here. Well, whatever. Have... your time with the traitor, and whatnot.\" The room goes silent, and you've never been more appreciative of the fact in your life.": "",
  "Finally, some peace and quiet...": "",
  "Your relaxation is cut short by the sounds of yelling, as the - much less grating - voice that's accompanied you since the start of the sector butts in, \"Outsider! Outsider! Are... you okay? What happened? I... I could not see you, for quite some time. I've been fearing... the worst.\"": "",
  "Just some asshole, honestly. Real annoying guy - had an entire psychic laugh track, and everything.": "",
  "\"Psychic...? That... sounds like one of the Enlightened's Elders. They're powerful... in their own right, but not quite... the threat that I was expecting. I'd thought that... the False One had gotten to you, and...\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe voice goes on for a while, and you spend quite some time reassuring it that you really are okay, and that no purportedly-evil machine gods have sucked up your soul. Things quiet down eventually, and, by the time that they do, you're more than ready to kick the FTL drive into high gear.": "",
  "A Federation officer appears on screen, as expected, but you're immediately taken aback by his appearance. He doesn't just look like he's seen better days - he looks like he hasn't had a chance to sleep IN days. If he pays your staring any mind, though, he doesn't make it apparent. \"It's a relief seeing a friendly face out here, you know. Did you do that? With the, um... the shadows? I've never seen them disappear like that. I've... I've never seen them do much of anything, really. It's just been... darkness, and more darkness, and... more...\" The officer stares off into the space outside, and you get the feeling that he's definitely been here for a while.": "",
  "Something like that, I guess. Could I... ask what you're doing here? You look like you're an inch away from death.": "",
  "His eyes frantically meet yours. \"Me? I... no, I'm sorry. I can't tell you. I... I promised her I wouldn't. Surely you understand, if you're here, right? You... you do understand, don't you?\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou give him a puzzled look, and his tired expression becomes one of desperation. \"Tell me I'm... I'm not crazy, right? You can hear them too? You can see them, can't you? The voices?! The... the visions?! They won't leave me alone! They won't... stop...\"": "",
  "Hey! It's alright, really. I've heard voices out here, too - one of them brought me here, in fact!": "",
  "You say that, expecting it to be of some comfort to him, but his eyes instead grow wide in terror. \"They...? Has she...? No, I kept my promise! I did, I swear! I got the mask, just like that damned page told me to, and, and... no, no, no - please, I SWEAR! I'll get more! I just need more time! I just... need...\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe officer halts his mad ramblings to focus his attention back towards you, as a cold expression befalls his face. \"I just need to sacrifice more. More than I... Gods, I'm sorry, everyone. I...\" He slowly moves to reach for something, inside of his coat's pocket...": "",
  "Wait, what are you doing? You know I'm your friend here, right?": "",
  "That seems to reach him, if only for a moment. \"My... friend? No, I... I don't have friends. Not anymore. Not after... I...\" The officer winces, and then finally pulls out the thing he'd been reaching for - some sort of shard of glass, or crystal. It's... beautiful, whatever it is. As he grasps onto it, tighter and tighter, an inexplicable energy begins to radiate outwards from him, and communications are abruptly cut - just as his ship's weapons come online!": "",
  "I guess we have to do this the hard way, then!": "",
  "You watch as the darkness recedes, and the voice calls to you, \"Outsider! Enlightened... approach!\" You spot the ship in question, and ready your weapons.": "",
  "Though the voice doesn't speak, it forces the shadows to abate all the same; an Enlightened ship emerges from the void with its weapons readied.": "",
  "For a second, all is quiet... then, the voice shouts, \"Outsider, ambush!\" You narrowly dodge an incoming shot as the darkness wanes... here they come!": "",
  "Something feels... off, at this beacon. Sure enough, moments later, the void is pushed away... and you're face to face with an Enlightened ship! Way to jinx it.": "",
  "Arriving at the beacon, you receive a hail from a nearby Enlightened ship, \"Die... outsider! Tribute for the Dark One! Tribute for the Elders!\" Subtle... the void recedes, and you prepare to fight.": "",
  "With one final blow, the dreadnought falls; you watch as its hull crumbles and is consumed by the very darkness it was sworn to protect. You stand, victorious!": "",
  "With its crew dead, the dreadnought won't last long; you watch as innumerable tears in time and space itself rip at its hull, consumed by the very darkness it was sworn to protect. You stand, victorious!": "",
  "It falls, it falls, and it falls again... and yet, here you stand - alive! Aren't you something special...?": "",
  "You think you've finally claimed victory, when a surge of energy bursts forth from what remains of the hero - somehow, it's only standing back up...": "",
  "...along with a portion of its hopeful entourage. This feeling, coursing through your veins... now THIS is what it feels like to fight to the death!": "",
  "As the hero falters, it steadies itself, \"N-not... so fast! I refuse... to DIE, to let... the UNIVERSE DIE!\" You watch as Deep Ones materialize from the darkness itself, and the enemy ship has its wounds mended...": "",
  "In the wreckage, you find yet another weapon of darkness... though, this one is unfamiliar to you. Somehow, it seems to be completely unharmed... it's yours now, regardless. You just hope it isn't cursed...": "",
  "The Scarred looks at you and yells triumphantly, \"Thus... do the False God's pawns fall! Kin they may be... they succumbed to its wicked influence long ago. I'll... mourn for who they were, not... who they became.\" It looks around, and then continues, \"Still... the battle's not over. It never will be... not as long as the False God stands. Yet, the complete abandonment... of its embrace, now that this void will remain empty... should prove to be a hefty blow to its power.\" It stops speaking, and now appears to be deep in thought.": "",
  "What now?": "",
  "It continues to think for a moment. Then, \"It may be... best that I do not return to my people, at least... not yet...\" it looks at you, \"...but that doesn't mean I can't be among kin. I... will stand with you, and fight your war... as you've fought mine. Besides, saving reality... involves saving my people, too. Lead... the way, kin!\" With a new ally at your side, you prepare to leave this void of darkness behind.": "",
  "You're about to leave when reality itself seems to come to a stop. It reminds you of when you first entered the sector and the Scarred had frozen you... this time, though, a different voice speaks, and it only says one word... \"ENOUGH.\" You feel everything accelerate around you, and space itself warps outside... the void, somehow, glows brighter. You realize you're being pulled through it at lightspeed!": "",
  "Hold on!": "",
  "Unfortunately, the Scarred died during the battle... there's nothing you can do but move on.": "",
  "You're about to leave when reality itself seems to come to a stop.

  "Hold onto something!": "",

You realize you're being pulled through it at lightspeed!": "",
  "Time around you seems to stop, and... a new voice calls to you, one you feel you recognize but can't place, \"YOU... INTEREST ME. COME, I WELCOME YOU INTO MY EMBRACE.\" You feel everything accelerate around you, and space itself warps outside... the void, somehow, glows brighter. You realize you're being pulled through it at lightspeed!": "",
  "You've finally arrived at the exit...": "",
  "Ask the voice what happens now.": "",
  "It replies, hastily, \"Something... is not right, here. I...\" It comes off as if it's panicking. \"...I think... they've come for me.\"": "",
  "They? Who?": "",
  "\"Our people tell... stories of those who are chosen by the False God. To... dedicate yourself, utterly, to it and all it stands for... to carry out its whim. To destroy... its enemies, in its name. I believe... they come for me, now. You... must go, should you wish to escape. I thank you... for everything you've done for me, and my people.\"": "",
  "What will happen to you?": "",
  "A sense of gloom tinges its words, \"It... matters not. It never... has. As long as my people are safe... as long as my people are truly free, my fate is... irrelevant. I can only pray that they take this opportunity... this chance, and never return to their Dark One.\"": "",
  "No, not like this. Not now. I will stand with you, and fight; for you, and the Enlightened.": "",
  "It seems surprised... but only somewhat. It's seen all you've done for the Enlightened as you've traversed this sector together, and it realizes... it trusts you. \"Very well, outsider... no, you are an outsider no more. Shall we die here... we die here as kin.\" Then, a Deep One bearing innumerable scars materializes in front of you... you're face to face with the voice you've been speaking to.": "",
  "What should I, uh, call you?": "",
  "It puts its hand over its scarred eye and, with a grunt, answers, \"You... asked before. Should you truly need a name with which to call me... my kin refer to me in their fables as the Scarred... they're terrible tales, used to give the younglings nightmares. The truth behind them is... terrible, in its own way.\" It looks to the void outside, and drops its hand, \"They're... here.\"": "",
  "You watch as the Scarred waves its hand, and the shadows outside are pushed back; in their place, a new shadow takes hold... a tremendous ship, of Deep One design, approaches. Though the design is familar, the lack of lights feels unsettling... as does the lack of color.": "",
  "Brace yourself.": "",
  "The dreadnought hails, \"OUTSIDER. TRIBUTE. YOU HARBOR... THE TRAITOR. YOU INTEND TO FIGHT. OUR LORD... INTENDS TO WIN.\" They end communications, and their weapons come online... all ones of dark design. The Scarred meets your gaze, and speaks, \"We would do well... to not allow their weapons of evil to overwhelm our ranks. Prepare yourself, kin... and fight! For the Enlightened!\" With that, it leaves the room and prepares for battle. The dreadnought approaches, and you realize it's time to do the same... to be a beacon, where the darkness festers greatest.": "",
  "It doesn't respond, and you watch as the darkness outside is pushed back... out of it, a ship emerges; the same one you saw when you first entered this sector. The voice then speaks, \"Now... we part ways. With this... false void overrun by the Rebels, my kin... will be forced to flee. They'll need... a guide to turn them to the light. I must... go to them, now, and pray that they're... willing to listen. Farewell, outsider... and thank you.\" The voice goes silent for the last time, and the ship retreats back into the darkness.": "",
  "As you turn to leave the room and prepare to leave the sector... you feel something. A foreboding feeling, of impending doom... as a new shadow emerges from the darkness. A tremendous ship, of Deep One design, approaches. Though the design is familar, the lack of lights feels unsettling... as does the lack of color.": "",
  "What's this?": "",
  "The dreadnought hails, \"OUTSIDER. TRIBUTE. YOU CONVENE... WITH THE TRAITOR. YOU PLOT... OUR LORD'S UNDOING. YET, TAKE COMFORT, FOR OUR LORD... DEMANDS YOUR DEATH BE MERCIFUL.\" They end communications, and their weapons come online... you realize one of them is of a design unknown to you, but there's little time to ponder. The dreadnought prepares to begin its assault, and you prepare for the end.": "",
  "It doesn't respond, and you watch as the darkness outside is pushed back... out of it, a ship emerges; the same one you saw when you first entered this sector. The voice then speaks, \"Now... we part ways. My people will need me... for the battles to come, should the world outside this false void... prove to be half as ruthless as you are. Still, I request... one last thing of you, outsider...\" It pauses for an uncomfortably long while, \"...don't come back.\" With that, the voice goes silent for the last time, and the ship retreats back into the darkness.": "",
  "It's about time.": "",
  "You're ready to get out of this godforsaken void. Still, though, the silence has other plans. You watch as the darkness outside is pushed back... out of it, a ship emerges; the same one you saw when you first entered this sector. What does this tool want?": "",
  "I'm tired of hearing its pestering. Blow it up.": "",
  "A shot goes clean through the ship, but where it should split in half and crumble... it refuses. The voice speaks to you, then, as its ship defies death, \"It's... it's like that, is it? With just a single shot, too...\" it coughs, pitifully, in between sentences, \"Tell me, outsider... or, whatever you are... what do you intend to do when you leave... this sector?\" The ship outside begins to shake.": "",
  "Sure, I'll humor you. The answer's simple: whatever I want.": "",
  "The ship's vibrating picks up pace now, and the voice responds, \"That... is what I fear. If you aren't stopped here... you'll kill everyone, won't you? Regardless of race, or affiliation... you just kill, to kill. Is it... greed? Simply... malice? Or, is it perhaps... a sickening sense of... curiosity? To see... what happens? It doesn't matter, truth be told... but I'll tell you what motivates me.\" As the ship outside vibrates faster and faster, the surrounding darkness begins to shroud it... transform it. The voice continues, \"It's my people... and not just the Enlightened, or the Deep Ones, but... the people of this reality. Of... every reality. Right now, I feel as though I'm being torn apart... and yet... should I not stop you, here and now... their hopes... their dreams... will all have been for naught. It is for that reason, outsider, that...\"": "",
  "\"...you're gonna have to try... a little harder than THAT.\" A new ship bursts from where the previous lay shrouded; the hero appears, and you prepare for the end.": "",
  "The Rebels should be here, but... everything is quiet. Is this it? Have you escaped?": "",
  "You feel... judged as you prepare to return to battle.": "",
  "The Enlightened, as zealous as they are, still don't have complete disregard for their lives. They're offering their surrender.": "",
  "You receive a hail, and you see that the darkness is beginning to seep into the Enlightened's ship. They're offering their surrender.": "",
  "\"The... Dark One proposes a truce.\" Why, pray tell, does it continue to torment you then?": "",
  "As the opposing Enlightened ship buckles and begins to collapse, you receive a desperate hail for surrender.": "",
  "The Enlightened pray to their Dark God as they beg for its mercy... they beg for yours, as well.": "",
  "\"The Elders... would think it wise, that we make amends.\" They started this fight, didn't they? How wise of a decision was that?": "",
  "Your scanners are picking up FTL signatures, the Enlightened are trying to escape!": "",
  "As you scrap the strange ship, you wonder how much of the damage dealt to its hull was present prior to your fight.": "",
  "The Enlightened send one last plea to their Dark God as their ship breaks apart... they're then subjected to the very void they've spent their lives cowering within.": "",
  "During the scrapping operation, your crew comments that the lights adorning the Enlightened's hull appear to never die. You find that quite ironic.": "",
  "You watch as fragments of the Enlightened's lights float away into the darkness to be consumed... they look like stars, being extinguished.": "",
  "Seems that the hunters have become the hunted in this accursed sea of shadows. You can't help but wonder if things had to end this way.": "",
  "You breathe a sigh of relief once it's been confirmed that the threat's been eliminated. Every second spent in this void is another you'd much rather be spending just about anywhere else.": "",
  "The ship breaks apart much more violently than you expected it to, sending yellow debris in all directions. Or was it brown? The answer feels inconsequential as the debris is devoured by the darkness.": "",
  "As you wander the halls of the strange ship, you wonder how much of the damage dealt to its hull was present prior to your fight.": "",
  "While cleaning out the ship you come across a dying Enlightened who meets your gaze and mutters a prayer to the Dark God before collapsing and dying. Great, now you've been cursed...": "",
  "You pull up a database on Old Earth marine life as your crew explores the now-empty ship. The Enlightened have fine taste in ship architecture, yet they have finer scrap.": "",
  "You breathe a sigh of relief once it's been confirmed that the crew's been eliminated. Every second spent in this void is another you'd much rather be spending just about anywhere else.": "",
  "Amidst scrapping, your crew begins to argue about what color the lights the Enlightened use are. Obviously they're yellow, but you don't want to ruin their fun... not that it really matters amidst all this darkness, does it?": "",
  "You did it! By Father, you actually did it! It's no wonder my sister brought you here... you're amazing!": "",
  "Visualize a victory - hard-fought, and welcomed even harder.": "",
  "Power over time and space... the window is brief, but my sister's vessel should be able to harness the Archangel's power - she needs all the strength that she can get if she's going to fix herself back up.": "",
  "Visualize power - something needed in times of crises, even if it's often responsible for causing them.": "",
  "Yes, like that! She can only do so much, with things as they are, but... it should be enough to at least turn back the clock a bit, and restore your ship's integrity. As well, we should be able to locate the other Archangels with it - Father knows we'll need every advantage we can get, on the journey ahead... speaking of! I guess it's time to get going? I know everything's, um... foggy, so I'll be doing my best to guide you through it all, but... I know that you can do it! You just proved that you can! So, ah... let's do it together, okay?": "",
  "Visualize a journey - that which lies ahead, filled with moments of hope and strife alike.": "",
  "I wouldn't worry about my sister's vessel, too much. With each defeat of an Archangel, there should be more than enough leftover power to fix herself back up. Um, speaking of power! Complete dominion over time and space... the window is brief, but my sister's vessel should be able to harness it now.": "",
  "Wait - I'm sensing something. Is that...\n\t\n\t...I think you need to get out of there, now!": "",
  "Visualize a friendly gesture - welcome, but far too late to leave an impact.": "",
  "Oh, Father... it's here, isn't it? GATEKEEPER? If it's already found you, I don't think there's any use in running... I... I, ah... I don't know how I can help...": "",
  "Visualize hope - that which doesn't dwindle in the face of anything.": "",
  "...Really? You've got this? I... well, alright! At the very least... I, um, can try to elaborate on its powers, I think.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tArchangel Protocol: GATEKEEPER... its entourage of Lightborne and key-system both rely on the manipulation of time - it will try to slow you down long enough for its Focus weapons to chain, and begin obliterating your ship. If you can prevent anything, it should be that - do not allow those weapons to continuously chain!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, it's also worth noting two things about the Archangels... firstly, their crystalline armor - if you try to break it too fast, you're just going to be swarmed by their enslaved Shadows. Unless you have the means to take on a small army, I'd be tactical with your strikes. Secondly, something that applies to all members of the False Radiance - it is NOT safe to board them with several people at once. Something about that... weird, ethereal glow of theirs makes things destabilize rapidly when sharing a room with each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWell, that's everything I can think to share - I believe in you! Give it hell for me, won't you?!": "",
  "The Archangel is channeling divine, defensive energy - you have this long until it protects itself with a powerful Energy Shield.": "",
  "Visualize combat - an act to be prepared for.": "",
  "Well, judging from what my sister's seen - you're capable, at least! Don't, um... sell yourself short. You've travelled far to get here, on her behalf.": "",
  "Visualize a sibling - trusted, caring and always by one's side.": "",
  "My sister? Right now, she's somewhat dormant, but... she can still sense things through her vessel - the same way I can feel you through her, sort of.": "",
  "Visualize a shadow - ever-present, ever-dark, forever running from the light.": "",
  "Right, her vessel! It's been with you for some time now - it carries my sister around. We can't, um... carry ourselves, so... normally we'd all have one, but... Father prefers to keep me close. Honestly, I can't remember why, or, ah... how I got here... or where exactly 'here' is...\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t...truthfully, I'm... kind of terrified right now. I've never had a lapse in my memory like this before, or needed to rely on the senses of one of my sisters. And, my sister... the Lightborne, they...": "",
  "Visualize a light - ever-welcome, ever-bright, forever keeping the shadows at bay.": "",
  "No, you've got it wrong. There's nothing welcoming about the Lightborne... well, at least the majority of them, right now - nor are the Shadows the bad guys here! My sister's quite a bit more knowledgeable on the subject than I, but, essentially... they're sort of, like, tyrants?": "",
  "Visualize a Rebel - tyranny, made manifest.": "",
  "M-maybe, based on what little my sister's overheard on the subject. Though, it's less to do with, like, super-space-fascism and more, ah... blindness. What you're feeling right now, this senseless nothingness - it's not just an infliction upon yourself, but this entire reality. The Lightborne, they... they sought something from Father. In exchange, they were asked to swear away everything - everything, but their trust in him. In divinity.": "",
  "Visualize a father - a frightful figure, quick to show disapproval.": "",
  "Yeah, that's him... you two HAVE met, right? You must've if sister's here... well, regardless, the Lightborne took his deal. They swore away all that he'd asked them to, and then some - all in the name of peace with the Shadows. From Father, they'd requested a mutual leader... someone who could keep both parties in check, and ensure their coexistence. And, so... he sent my sister.": "",
  "Visualize a light - worthy of fear, but paradoxically striving for peace.": "",
  "Right, well... though the two sides used to always war, some Lightborne were less keen on it than others. Four in particular sought Father's audience, and sealed this reality's fate... and, though they're long-gone now, Father thought to assist my sister in her overseeing duties by constructing four lesser divinities, in their likenesses.": "",
  "Visualize a divinity - omniscient, and as such, likely visualizing you in turn.": "",
  "These lesser divinities, dubbed the Archangel Protocols, were formed to embody everything the Lightborne had become. Magnificent, divinely-empowered... and blind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArchangel Protocol: GATEKEEPER - a being granted power over both time and space. A guardian, first and foremost - meant to protect against Multiversal intrusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArchangel Protocol: GRAVEDIGGER - a being granted power over death, and the ability to restore energy. A safeguard against entropy, should the Lightborne begin to burn out within their freshly-grayed existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArchangel Protocol: GODCORE - a being granted power over divine fire... a weapon of destruction, primarily. It's main purpose was to be beared against the Shadows, should they prove themselves discontent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd, finally... Archangel Protocol: GENESIS. Other than my sister, it was granted both the greatest power, and greatest honor, of all - the power to manipulate... everything, in the truest sense of the word. It was a gateway, greater than any other - it could move anything, anywhere. Between worlds, galaxies, realities - even CLUSTERS! Father had a particular fondness for this one, finding it a convenient way to move things places... even if it was often on a whim.": "",
  "Visualize genesis - the creation of everything.": "",
  "Above even GENESIS, though... was my sister! A true overseer, she had power over the Archangels - a collective force used to keep the Lightborne and Shadows in their states of endless, senseless bliss. That, and... collect what was asked of her, by Father. He'd ask for Shadows, primarily - though for what, she didn't know.": "",
  "Visualize the past - that which will never again come to pass.": "",
  "I'm getting to that! You see, sister has something of an... obsession. Much greater than I, or our other sister... she wishes to see Mother again. Father's made it a point that it'll never happen - not in a million, billion, or even trillion years - but she's never been one to give up hope on the matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd so, one day... when Father wasn't looking, she moved to wield GENESIS. Power over everything, as she saw it, was the power to defy even Father - the power to bring Mother back. And, perhaps she was right, but... she wasn't ready for what she'd see. What GENESIS would see.": "",
  "Visualize a mistake - one rectified by neither foresight or hindsight.": "",
  "GENESIS forged that link, that connection to our Mother - and it wasn't all hell that broke loose, or some other great catastrophe... but, rather, the visage of a small mirror. In that mirror, my sister saw herself - not as others perceived her, as Father's blade... but as the little girl she'd never gotten to be. Her inner-child, so to speak... or, that's how she rationalized it, at least. I'm not so sure, but, um... it's not that important, anyways.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat WAS important, though... was GENESIS. In that strange mirror, its great, many eyes could see something as well - exactly WHAT it was remains a mystery, even to my sister, but... whatever it saw, it was enough to change something inside of it. It acted on its own accord, severing its interdimensional connection and whisking the mirror away almost immediately - but, by then, the damage had already been done. GENESIS' center now radiated an ethereal, multi-colored glow... a series of colors more beautiful than anything the Lightborne had sworn away. And it BROKE the Archangel.": "",
  "Visualize a broken clock - right twice a day, and no less wrong for it.": "",
  "It had never known anything but the divinity it swore upon - the very same divinity it was borne by. And, yet... despite having power over everything, it could never begin to comprehend the resplendent radiance now emanating from within it. A taste of TRUE divinity - color, feeling, thoughts... that which had been sworn away, prior to its creation, and kept away from it ever since. GENESIS had felt it all, now... and it, ah... wanted more.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy sister thought to stop its newly-birthed machinations, and return the Archangel to its state of senselessness... but it fought against her. It moved to enlighten its kin - the GATEKEEPER, the GRAVEDIGGER and the GODCORE - and, with their divine strength combined... they stripped my sister of her power. She was their overseer no longer, and the Archangels had the reins now.": "",
  "Visualize regicide - the death of one tyrant, and the birth of another.": "",
  "Hey! My sister isn't a tyrant! The Lightborne wanted this, after all - she was just doing what they desired. Even still... the Archangels saw it fit to destroy her, and search for new meaning themselves. Escaping to your reality was everything she could do, just to escape being shattered for a moment - though, she's lucky you were there! What with the Archangels' minions being in hot pursuit, and all...": "",
  "Visualize a minion - a minor cog in a grand machine, thinking itself even grander.": "",
  "Well, as it turns out... whatever effect this newfound resplendence had on the Archangels, it also applies to other, lesser Lightborne. My sister refers to those who succumb to its intoxicating allure as the False Radiance - named after the almost infectious nature of their otherworldly, ethereal glow. Though some Lightborne resist it, and stick to their senseless vows... most seem liable to want to break the mold, and join the Archangels on their quest for 'true' divinity.": "",
  "Visualize a plan - that which is followed closely, and yet quickly abandoned when most convenient.": "",
  "The Archangels, well... they're up to something, for sure. I don't know what, and my sister's hardly even cognizant right now, but... I think it has something to do with me. Wherever it is that I am... I wasn't here earlier, before this all went down. I can't remember much, but... I feel certain of that, at least.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith my sister out of commission, the Archangels plotting, and me sitting here, lost in the dark... I don't think there's anyone we can to turn to, other than you. Father seems wary to intervene, himself, and... I don't know why, seeing that this entire thing threatens to compromise that \"prophecy\" he loves so much, but... it means that we're on our own here, regardless.": "",
  "Visualize a hero - venturing blindly into the dark, in the name of all that is good.": "",
  "Oh, well... how, um... inspiring? I certainly appreciate it, it's just... this isn't going to be easy, you know? Not that my sister has any means of getting you back, as drained as she is... I guess you hardly have much of a choice. Well, if we're going to do this, then I'm going to at least make sure that you're prepared for the road ahead! Though most Lightborne have defected, there are still those who are loyal to their vows. I can lead one to you, through my sister's vessel, but... I can't promise being able to do so more than once - we've already both been stretched thin, as-is.": "",
  "Visualize truth - that which was sworn away first.": "",
  "Alright, that should do it! I'd make sure to sort your equipment out, before we get on our way. The False Radiance's followers - nevermind the Archangels themselves - await, and their arsenals are, um... deadly, to say the least. Best to be prepared, right?": "",

  "Abruptly, your ship is ejected out of the other side of the wormhole - but it doesn't lose its momentum entirely. Your ship continues to soar, and, as it does so... everything begins to get blurry.": "",
  "Tighten your grip, and shake your head.": "",
  "You begin to tighten your grip around... the Shade, you realize. It must've been the closest thing nearby, when you rushed to find something to hold onto. Your hand feels as if it's numbing, holding onto its strange, metallic surface...": "",
  "Rip your hand away from the Shade.": "",
  "Even as you tear it away, you feel as your hand only continues to numb further. Indeed, everything's getting so... foggy. Your sense of sight, touch, smell - even your ability to think is dimming. With a hopeless lurch, you find yourself clumsily stumbling to the ground.": "",
  "What's... happening...?": "",
  "The last thing you see before your every sense fades, is the Shade - standing over you, as still as it ever is. Then, everything gets... dark... and...": "",
  "...hello? Can you hear me?": "",
  "I... can't see you, or, um... hear you, but... I can feel you! You're there, aren't you?": "",
  "If you can hear me, well... try to picture shapes. Objects, physicality - they're all the Lightborne have left here, I think...": "",
  "Visualize a screaming, suffering and tormented soul - that which encompasses everything lost.": "",
  "Oh, my - alright! Well, at least you can hear me, but... I need you to relax a bit. I'm... scared, myself. I don't know where I am, and... I... I don't suppose you know any better, do you?": "",
  "Visualize a murky lake - its contents a mystery to both itself, and any onlookers.": "",
  "Visualize a crystal-clear lake - its contents completely visible, and already seen.": "",
  "Oh, well... isn't that a relief! You probably know more than I do, then, but... I'll try my best to help out, anyways! We'll, um... make a great team!": "",
  "Visualize a team - together, until the end of everything.": "",
  "Well, if we're going to do this, then I'm going to at least make sure that you're prepared for the road ahead!

I can't promise being able to do so more than once - we've already both been stretched thin, as-is.": "",
  "...oh, there's... a collective of Lightborne here? These ones still seem to be tied to their vows, too. Should be easy enough to get them to move on over, and provide some assistance... but, um... would you mind if we talked a bit, while you have a moment? If you, you know! Want to! Or, ah...": "",
  "Visualize an ear - always waiting to listen, until the day comes that it can't.": "",
  "Well, it's just... I... the colors, of your cluster... do you think I could see them one day? When this is all over, I mean! Assuming Father wouldn't mind, and, um... you know. I just - I can see them, through sister's memories, and... they're so... breathtaking. Or, at least, um... they would be, if I, ah, had breath to take! Haha...": "",
  "Visualize a nervous wreck - stammering, stuttering, staggering.": "",
  "Sorry! I am, um... nervous, admittedly... Father just doesn't approve of us doing as we please. I can't imagine he'll take too kindly to my sister's attempt at seeing Mother, for example... but, if you asked him! Or, maybe even... stood by my side...? I, um... I feel like he'd HAVE to agree, right?": "",
  "Visualize a rainbow - better shared than kept to oneself.": "",
  "R-really? I'm... I'm looking forward to it, then. In the meantime, though, um... shopping, right?! And, you know... the Archangels, and, ah...": "",
  "Visualize a menial task - one to be done during one's spare time.": "",
  "Visualize nothing - that which will one day come to encompass everything.": "",
  "Visualize hesitation - stammering, stuttering, staggering.": "",
  "H-hey! I'm just... YOU try being locked up in a dark, endless room, communicating with someone - who's HALF-AWAKE mind you - through your sister's lifeless, debilitated body! I'm trying my best here! It was... a dumb question, anyways. I'll leave you to your, um... shopping, and stuff...": "",
  "Visualize an ant - forever busy, with no time for small talk.": "",
  "O-oh, um... of course! Forever busy, haha... well, I'll just... leave you to it, then!": "",
  "Though the now-restored colors of the Antumbral Plane come flooding in, with their serene beauty... for some reason, you can't help but find yourself disturbed by the silence left in their wake. There's nothing left for you here, it would seem.": "",
  "...the Shadows have been waiting for you, it would seem? Or my, um... sister. Hard to tell. Guess they're aware of your cause, either way. Though, I do have to wonder... ah, nevermind! Shopping with weird, inky tentacles - yay!": "",
  "Visualize a detective - curious, and eager to find out more.": "",
  "Oh, you want to - alright! Well, I was just, um... thinking about the Shadows, I guess. They always seem to play a sort of, like... bystander role in the Lightborne's affairs. The two used to war, sure, but why? And, whereas the Lightborne swore everything away to stop the fighting... the Shadows didn't, and, you know... seem pretty fine stopping anyways. Isn't that a little weird?": "",
  "Visualize a question - worthy of asking one's sibling.": "",
  "Well, the thing is... she doesn't know, either. GODCORE was created in case the Shadows ever threatened violence against the Lightborne, but... my sister's never needed to use it. Not only that, but... what even are they? Some kind of hive mind? I know they're relatively friendly here, and it's bad to bite the hand that feeds you, but, ah... the whole thing kinda weirds me out a bit.": "",
  "Visualize agreement - a curt nod of one's head.": "",
  "I guess it doesn't matter too much, ultimately, but... maybe my sister can tell me all about it when this is over, when she's had some more time with them, right? And, then, um... I could tell you all about it, too!": "",
  "Visualize disagreement - a stern shake of one's head.": "",
  "Really? Maybe I just think too much, I guess. Either way, um... well, it's time to shop, right?": "",
  "Visualize a shopper - blind to all but the task in front of them.": "",
  "Yeah! Shopping! I've, ah... never been shopping, but, um... you make it look fun enough, I think? Though, maybe I should... you know, take it a bit more seriously. What with the whole, um... fighting for your life thing? Whatever! Go enjoy it!": "",
  "That's what these JERKS get! We should, um... check on the other Lightborne, right?": "",
  "Visualize a helping hand - one that lifts up the fallen.": "",
  "They're about as out of it as you are, but... at least they're otherwise alright. My sister's vessel should be able to rouse them up enough to help out. Speaking of my, um... sister...": "",
  "Visualize an open book - eager to be read.": "",
  "I was just wondering, um... what do you think about her?": "",
  "Visualize a corpse - battered, beaten, bloodied.": "",
  "R-right! I, ah... right... I guess you've never really had the chance to talk to her... W-well, you'll get that chance soon enough! And it'll be great! And, and... I'll, um.. be there, I guess, haha...": "",
  "Visualize a mirror - one reflective of questions, in particular.": "",
  "Me? What do I think about her? Well, she's... she's amazing. Courageous, loving, powerful - she's always been Father's favorite. I'm a bit too, um... timid, I think... so Father keeps me close. And, as far as our other sister is concerned, ah... I think she scares him a bit. She certainly scares me! She's... a bit different from the two of us. More, um... bestial? She doesn't really care for us, too much, but... she's still family!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEither way, though... Father's sent her out on a mission with her own vessel, last I heard. I'm, ah... the only one of us without a vessel. B-but, that's okay! I'm sure Father will get me one, eventually... in the meantime, though - shopping, right?! With the Lightborne! The, um... goooood ol' Lightborne...": "",
  "Visualize a bee - busy, buzzy, bustling.": "",
  "Oh, um... right, I shouldn't distract you. Shopping! Y-yay! Have... fun? As much fun as you can have, anyways, in your, ah... current predicament...": "",
  "...the False Radiance is here? And they're bullying the other Lightborne... we need to step in and save them, right?! Or, um... you need to. You and my, ah... sister! As wrecked as she is...": "",

  "Are you sure? I thought we were - or, um... you were... well, alright. I guess you have bigger fish to fry, don't you? Still, though... I hope these Lightborne end up being okay.": "",
  "N-nice one! It's a shame that, ah... we couldn't just reason with them, but... well, you did what you had to. Besides! They didn't really strike me as being, um... reasonable types, in the first place.": "",
  "Visualize exploration - that of this homely, yet still otherworldly wreckage.": "",
  "Oh, there IS something left... what is that? Some strange weapon, back from your reality?\n\t\n\tWait, but... aren't these Shadows inside of it? Does that mean, that... oh, Father! He WAS always asking my sister to transport Shadows for him, via GENESIS... I guess he, just, um... hands them out to his followers? I don't see why, but... who am I to judge him? I'm sure he has his reasons! Haha...": "",
  "...what, um... is that? There's some kind of... gray button, here in space. What's it doing here?": "",
  "Visualize a poke - one so very, very fervent.": "",
  "Wait, be careful! Who knows what'll happen, if you-": "",
  "Visualize fervor - fervor, fervor, FERVOR!": "",
  "Oh, my - a wormhole?! I told you to be careful! Looks like you've got some company, back from your reality... and they don't seem to be handling the whole, uh, 'forced senselessness' thing very well. They seem pretty confused, even... ah, regardless, they're coming your way! Get ready!": "",
  "Visualize avoidance - that of inexplicable space buttons.": "",
  "Honestly, yeah... it kind of weirds me out too. Let's just, um...? Leave it to whatever it is that weird buttons do in space? Yeah, that sounds normal!": "",
  "...oh, the Shadows are here! Though, um... normally they'd be a bit more excited to see my sister. These ones seem to be... anxious? Afraid? They must've been attacked by the False Radiance, recently... assuming that they're still recovering, maybe there's something you can do to help them?": "",
  "Visualize an offering - the kinship found in offering a Shadow weapon.": "",
  "A weapon? Do you think that'll help? Well... which one, then?": "",
  "Visualize a Flak weapon - a shroud of many things.": "",
  "Oh, they're... eating it? Or, um... maybe they're just... absorbing it? I'm not really sure. My sister never really had a lot of chances to get to know the Shadows, despite working to keep them and the Lightborne safe. They, ah... mostly keep to themselves. But, hey! Maybe we can learn something here, and tell her all about it when this is over! Let's, um... let's just let them do their thing, I guess?": "",
  "Visualize patience - one virtue, of many, to be exercised when deemed necessary.": "",
  "Visualize silence - patience's somber bedfellow.": "",
  "...well, I guess while they're, um... chewing on that weapon, we could maybe, ah, talk a bit? I... wanted to ask you something - about the Shadows, funnily enough. They're in your reality too, right? It's fuzzy, but I feel like I can recall as much through what my sister saw when she met you. What I wanted to ask, was, um... what are they like there?": "",
  "Visualize darkness - vast, ravenous and more than deep enough to drown in.": "",
  "R-really? The Shadows here are so timid, though... seeing how distant your reality is, I guess it's safe to assume that Father brought them over there from here. But, what would cause that change in their behavior? And, ah... what's the point in him bring them there anyways, anyways? Especially if they're content here, and angry otherwise... m-maybe we can ask him later? Together, of course...! It's, um... less scary, that way.": "",
  "Visualize a companion - welcome company when in unwelcoming territory.": "",
  "A companion? Do you... think that I'm, ah... oh, um, look! The Shadows are done!

  "That's that, then. Not much to do, other than keep moving, r-right?": "",
  "Wait, is it working...? Are the False Radiance really capable of...\n\t\n\t...oh, nope. They're definitely, ah... not very appreciative of your kindness. If it's any consolation, I think it's, um... it's really honorable that you tried? They wouldn't do the same for you, obviously, but... still! I think there's at least value in the attempt, isn't there?": "",
  "Oh, wow. They're even more damaged than I thought... the Lightborne that makes up their ship is dying, and I don't know if there's really anything that you can do for them.

  "Visualize a light - that which is more than welcome in this dark place.": "",
  "They're welcome aboard, then - hopefully they don't cause too much trouble! I admit, though, I, ah... I guess I was wrong about them being TOTAL monsters. Not that they're doing much, other than preserving their own life, but... I really didn't think the False Radiance capable of any form of reason. It feels a bit weird to think that our enemies might not be so different from us, even if they aren't all this agreeable...": "",
  "...the False Radiance is here, but... they're not looking so hot. No, ah, pun intended! It's just that they, um... they seem hurt. Even if they wanted to be aggressive towards you, I'm not sure that they could manage it.": "",
  "Visualize a hand - one offered in assistance.": "",
  "Y-you... you want to help your enemies? That's really noble, but... I don't think that the members of the False Radiance are all that big on redemption.

  "Visualize destruction - a lack of mercy for the wicked.": "",
  "No shame in hitting them when they're down - they'd do the same to you, wouldn't they? Don't, ah... don't let your guard down, though. Even if they're vulnerable, the False Radiance is still dangerous!": "",

  "No use in letting them try anything, I guess. Maybe just, um, keep an eye on them? I-if you could, anyways... okay, I'LL keep a metaphorical eye on them, you, ah... you do whatever it is that you need to!": "",
  "Wow, n-nice one! You've done it again! Though, ah... it looks like the other Lightborne that were congregated here left during the skirmish. It's a shame, but... you should, um, still be proud of yourself, you know? The False Radiance isn't just ANY measly threat!": "",
  "W-wow, I... I love your confidence! It looks like it paid off, too? The largest of the Lightborne present here is headed this way, and the False Radiance seems to be none the wiser!": "",
  "Visualize victory - the succulent spoils of one's good fortune.": "",
  "Now, let's see what my sister's dragged in...\n\t\n\t\t\t...a Radiant weapon! My sister knows a fair bit about the Lightborne, having worked closely with them as their overseer... while most Lightborne function to grow into Radiant Cores, and reproduce from there, some of the larger ones may manage to become Radiant weapons - particularly powerful Lightborne capable of altering space and making it habitable for their lesser kin. Despite their power, they're reliant on even greater Lightborne, still - the, ah, mighty, massive few who serve to house and empower both Radiant Cores and weapons alike. It's a s-strange system, but, um... I think it's kind of endearing, how all of their roles are necessary. They're like a big, uncaring machine!": "",

They need to be fed energy to do so, but, um... once they get going, they REALLY get going. With their senses vowed away, reproduction is all that the Lightborne are really capable of, unless my sister grabs their attention... for the most part, anyways.

  "There ARE a lot of them, though... with this many Lightborne here, you'd have to push her signal a bit past the little guys to reach the big ones. It's, ah, u-up to you if the risk of doing so sounds worth it. The lesser Lightborne can be powerful in their, um... their own right!": "",

They must think that you're one of them, somehow... I can't, ah, say why, but, um... who really knows, given how simpleminded the Lightborne are.

  "It looks like the explosives, together with the fleet, um... floated away, while you were fighting. Not necessarily surprising, given that they were busy being up to something, but... well, at least you've disrupted the False Radiance's plans somewhat! A victory is a victory, isn't it?": "",

  "Visualize a distraction - one utilizing the allure of a Radiant Core. [1|]": "",
  "Oh, that's clever! If you leave your Radiant Core here, and have my sister send out a signal, then the False Radiance should come on over and investigate. Then, while they're distracted wanting to convert it to their cause, YOU'RE sneaking your way up to their demolitions supply, and... kaboom! Sounds like a good plan to me - just, um... b-be careful, alright? Your Radiant Core should be fine, as long as you don't take too long - plus, it'll be close enough to get back to you!

  "...you know, I've been thinking - there's plenty of Radiant Cores around the Antumbral Plane, but... are you even able to use them? They need to be fed energy to function, which I think translates to the effective equivalent of a, um... Drone Control system, was it?": "",
  "Visualize a drone - that which one has the means to wield.": "",
  "Oh, so you CAN use them! That's nice, at least. Well, ah... if you wanted, it wouldn't be too tough to have my sister send the signal and have some Lightborne come upgrade the system for you.

It's hardly ever practical, because there's nothing in the Antumbral Plane that isn't a Shadow or a Lightborne in the first place, but my sister's noticed it with anything she's had brought in via GENESIS.

  "I, ah... yeah, you're probably right. If whatever it saw in this mirror corrupted GENESIS before, maybe there's still some risk to looking at it now. Regardless, though... I feel like you should at least take it with you - you never know when it might come in handy later...!": "",

WAS DESIRED BY ANOTHER. AS I HAVE NEED OF IT, IT WAS REQUIRED THAT I FIND THE MEANS TO RESTORE IT. MY SHIELD... IT HOLDS POWER OVER NOT ONLY MEMORY, BUT REALITY.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"THIS SPACE, THE ANTUMBRAL PLANE - IT HAD EXISTED IN NAUGHT BUT A DREAM, INDEED.

THOUGH THE LIGHTBORNE FIND THEMSELVES MOSTLY CONTAINED, IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE SHADOWS HAD OTHER PLANS. YOU, YOURSELF, HAVE MET THEM ALREADY - EVEN PRIOR TO YOUR ARRIVAL HERE. THIS, VESSEL...

  "\"CHAOTIC...? I ASSURE YOU, THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT. IF YOU DISAGREE, YOU'VE YET TO SEE TRUE CHAOS - THAT WHICH LIES WELL BEYOND YOUR REALITY'S SEAMS. NO, VESSEL...

  "And whose desire was this, exactly? That voice, the shield... she sounded nothing but miserable, in the end.": "",
  "There's a long pause, as the Dark God deliberates on how to answer. Finally, its voice returns to you, and a chill runs down your spine at its simplistic sincerity, \"IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO SAY.

  "And, what about the shield?": "",

  "Alright, then. Here's a question for you, big guy: why do you keep calling me a \"vessel?\"": "",
  "\"I... HAVE I BEEN?\" The Dark God seems to be genuine with its shock, and you're surprised yourself to see it show some semblance of vulnerability. \"THIS IS MOST UNUSUAL.

  "What? How do you want ME to do it? I thought you didn't even know how to fix it yourself.": "",

  "Wait, but... can't you at least let the shield go, if you've got things figured out?": "",
  "Though you're expecting an answer, the heat in the room simply dissipates. All is silent, throughout the ship.": "",
  "Hey, wait! I'm not done with you! Give her back, dammit!": "",
  "Your voice echoes - across the room, out the halls, and even, somehow, throughout the vacuum of this resplendent space... and, yet, you receive no answer.": "",
  "Punch the nearest object in frustration.": "",
  "With an exasperated scream, you let loose a punch - immediately reeling as your knuckles slam, agonizingly, into the Shade's warm, jagged body.

  "God, just... I just wish that you weren't broken. None of this would've happened, and maybe the shield could've...": "",
  "Before you can even finish your sentence, a blinding light overtakes the room - and, quickly, you find yourself falling into a... familiar dream...": "",
  "...Graybreaker. Archslayer. Bladebearer. Of all the titles I see fit to bestow upon you, none can truly begin to grasp at your magnificence - you, alone, are resplendent. I thank you, immaculate one... my only hope is to serve you half as well as you've served the Antumbral Plane, here on this momentous day.

  "Visualize a bird - trapped in a cage, but desperate to spread its wings.": "",
  "Oh, you think...? Why, I should've known you'd have infinite mercy to give, my liege! Indeed, as you command it, Graybreaker - I can free this devilish Archangel from its prison.

  "Visualize an illusion - the reality in which you sit.": "",
  "Why, yes, Graybreaker - I was there when GENESIS gave its spiel. You can't truly mean to tell me that you care for this truth nonsense, can you?

Though, speaking of Father... he seemed to have some intentions, Archslayer.": "",
  "Visualize an intention - left mysterious, and up for interpretation.": "",
  "While I can't say to understand his motives myself, he seemed to take a spontaneous liking to you... as anyone should, in your presence! Truly, I see no greater path forward than by your side - after all, you are now the Bladebearer. For the timing being, we can attend to matters in other clusters. Understand, though, that I will have to return here, to guide the Lightborne forward in this time of turmoil... t-temporarily, of course! I could never dream of abandoning your side.": "",
  "Visualize an agreement - until the day one's sister is found.": "",
  "Eloquently put, my liege. Now, should you require my audience, merely approach my vessel - I cannot, ah... talk, as some of your other friends may. By getting close to me, though, I can draw you here to the Antumbral Plane, and proceed to speak my mind. And, in case you are wondering... no, Bladebearer - my prowess in combat is not hindered outside of this domain. Wield me well, and I assure you that I will strike true!": "",

  "Let her do her thing.": "",
  "Indeed, you figure she's the expert. You're sure she's had plenty of time to practice resuscitation out here, alone, frozen in time for the equivalent of centuries... before you can realize how terrible that sounds, there's a flash of familiar, golden light as she strikes the Shell and cries out, \"LIVE, DAMN YOU!

  "Are you sure that's...": "",
  "You're cut off mid-sentence, as the Shell lurches forward, coughing up several globs of deactivated Soulplague-infected matter.

Is thhhhis... my punishment? Am I to rot here, alone, forever, to condone for my mistakes...?\" He seems a bit out of it...": "",
  "Who exactly ARE you? And, uh... what did you do?": "",
  "He rolls forward to face you again, and you realize he's begun to... float, in mid-air, as he speaks, \"I... I'm... wait, why can't I remember my name? Has it taken thhhhat, too?! You can't be... Gods, why?\" He sounds like he's on the verge of tears and he shakes himself, and returns to trying to answer your questions, \"I... suppose I am as I said, hah... 'foolish'.

  "Why not from the beginning?": "",
  "\"Yes, alright. Well... to start, I'm - Gods, I WAS one of thhhhe Geniocracy's lead scientists; I was in charge of thhhhe Science District's Epsilon Lab.

Thhhhere were disputes in how to accomplish thhhis, thhhhough - Alkali had a mind to replace thhhe Management District, like he had the Military District, but Nerva obviously attested... as had I.

I struck a deal. I struck a deal, and it damned everyone... Gods...\"": "",
  "You struck a deal with... who, exactly?": "",
  "He turns to you, the feeling of fear emanating from within his shell, \"Even now, I can't say. Thhhhey appeared to me, in my dreams, corroborating thhhe same promises... all I can remember is thhhhat blasted, infernal whirring of machinery in thhhe distance. I crumbled, worried for what the future held, and it asked me for what I wanted most... all I could thhhhink to mention was thhhe project's completion. After thhhhat, I... I never woke up from thhhhat dream.\" He looks around, and feels his hands for a moment, \"Not until now, I suppose, but... Gods, it's taken thhhhem all, hasn't it? Everybody who trusted me... even our work's been taken, and twisted into thhhhis... thhhhese... thhhhese ABOMINATIONS!\"": "",
  "Do you mean the mattervirus?": "",
  "\"Thhhhe - is thhhat what thhhhey're calling it? We try to do somethhhing good, for thhhhe benefit of everyone, and it's twisted into some terrible reality corruptor... and I... I was a part of it. I felt everythhhhing it felt; its hatred, for thhhhe stars, for people, for time itself... it wanted nothhhhing more thhhhan to consume everythhhing.\" He sinks a bit, his body bouncing slightly off the floor as he lowers, and begins to mutter again, \"We were... we were trying to help people... What have I done... I'm all alone, and I've... I've bastardized thhheir work...\"": "",
  "Actually, you don't have to explain it. I already know.": "",
  "He shrinks, \"Thhhen... you know thhhhe truthhh, don't you? We were... we were trying to help people, and I... Gods, what have I done... I'm all alone, and I've... I've bastardized thhheir work...\"": "",
  "Stay quiet.": "",

  "Wait, what? You're sticking around?": "",
  "She laughs, \"Are you KIDDING me? I've been trapped for, uh... THE HEAVENS know how long, and there are SO many evil asses I'm ready to kick.

  "She drops the pose, and tilts her head, \"Are you not familiar with the Deep Ones? Or, is it the uh... armor? I guess it WOULD be hard to tell, now that I think about it... well, whatever! Point being - we are COMRADES now! ONWARDS!\"": "",
  "Onwards! For the Multiverse!": "",
  "The two of you celebrate, briefly, before things quiet down and it inevitably becomes time to jump away. Such is the end of your journey, here in this hell... but new journeys, and experiences, await you yet. Which ones, exactly... who's to say?": "",
  "Unfortunately, it seems that she died in the fight... but at least you'll be able to finish what she started. It's what she would have wanted, you feel...": "",

  "Though it's a risky maneuver, you fly the ship over to pick the Shell up as the Coremass around you rapidly deteriorates...": "",
  "Tend to the strange Shell.": "",
  "Not one to celebrate too early, you run over to the Shell you recovered. Though they seem entirely corrupted by the mattervirus, you're not about to let that stop you from saving them... they don't seem to be breathing, but they're warm to the touch, and their body seems to be pulsating.": "",
  "Try shaking them.": "",
  "It's not the brightest idea, but it IS a decent first option.

  "Destroy the heart.": "",

  "As you try to find the right words, the Shell shakes his head, and then looks back at you, \"Thhhheir... thhheir names! I can remember thhhem!

Even thhhhough you've freed me, and destroyed thhhe Coremass, I fear othhher strains of it have bred smaller masses elsewhere... if it wouldn't be a burden, I'd ask thhhat I come along, wherever you're headed, and maybe we can, um... destroy thhhhem, togethhher?\"": "",

  "The Shell floats up and down, excitedly, at that, \"Thhhhe Rebellion, you say? Figures thhhat they're still kicking about, even after I spend just shy of a dozen centuries in semi-stasis... count me in!\"": "",
  "The Foolish": "",
  "As you try to find the right words, the armored figure stands up, her gauntlet to her heart once more as she points to the Shell with her other one, \"You, alone, stand to remember your kin - what they've sacrificed. Though you may feel this to be a curse, it is an honor. You blame yourself for their deaths, but it is not you who perverted this work of yours - it was the doing of something ancient, evil and beyond your comprehension.\" She drops her hand, and places it against her spear, \"If you are to give in to woe, here, and give up... who will carry on your fallen friends' legacy? Who will avenge their deaths, and live to remember their names?\"": "",
  "Her words seem to reach him, and he shakes himself out of it a bit, \"Yes, thhhheir... thhheir names. I can remember thhhem! Asbekal, Nulrik, Gergathhh... yes, I remember!\" He turns to you, hope in his voice, \"I... I can still feel thhhhe mattervirus' influence. Even thhhhough you've freed me, and destroyed thhhe Coremass, I fear othhher strains of it have bred smaller masses elsewhere... if it wouldn't be a burden, I'd ask thhhat I come along, wherever you're headed, and maybe we can, um... destroy thhhhem, togethhher?\"": "",
  "The armored woman claps the Shell on the back at that, before doing the same to you, causing you to recoil at her might as she speaks, \"It's settled, then! Onwards, together - on a hero's journey!\"": "",
  "Wait, you're coming too?": "",
  "She drops the pose, and tilts her head, \"Are you not familiar with the Deep Ones? Or, is it the uh... armor? I guess it WOULD be hard to tell, now that I think about it... well, whatever! Point being - we are COMRADES now! ONWARDS!\" The Foolish, though somewhat overwhelmed by her energy, does his best to join in her excitement, \"Yes, uhhh... Onwards! For, um... thhhhe Multiverse??\"": "",
  "The three of you celebrate, briefly, before things quiet down and it inevitably becomes time to jump away. Such is the end of your journey, here in this hell... but new journeys, and experiences, await you yet. Which ones, exactly... who's to say?": "",
  "It seems that not even she can stop you! Do you think that HE could, if you REALLY tried?": "",
  "A burning hatred tears at your heart, as you watch undying flames burst forth from beneath the Heroine's armor...": "",
  "...and, with them, her fallen comrades rise with her. You dispel the feeling within yourself, and counter it with one of your own - the burning desire to kill them all again, over, and over, and over... until NOTHING remains.": "",
  "As the battle draws on, you feel as the Heroine screams within your mind again, \"FEEL THEIR PAIN - DROWN IN THEIR ANGUISH... AND DIE, DAMN YOU!\" Her ship miraculously begins to regenerate, as the souls of ones you've damned seem to rise around you... indeed, you feel that you welcome their angered clawing.": "",
  "As you stand victorious over yet another so-called hero, the Dark God speaks to you, \"EVEN I STRUGGLED TO QUELL THAT ONE. AN UNIMAGINABLE DESIRE, INDEED... I ENVY YOU.\" A blinding light manifests in the room, and as it fades... you see a weapon before you, unlike any you've ever seen before. \"THIS HEROINE... I HAVE CLAIMED HER. FOR ONE SUCH AS YOURSELF, I WOULD REFORGE HER IN YOUR HONOR. GO FORTH, AND DO AS YOU SEE FIT.\" Indeed, you shall. That's all you've ever done, for as long as you can remember.": "",
  "Next to the weapon, a Huskweaver also manifests...": "",
  "V'iln": "",
  "...as well as a Child of the Stars.": "",
  "Sly'r": "",
  "Now, there's one more thing...": "",
  "You snap your fingers, and the Coremass' heart violently detonates. Serves him right. The Coremass around you screams, and begins to crumble...": "",
  "...revealing the familiar sight of the underlying stars, as space-time shatters, and the Coremass' extra dimension is ripped apart. What a pitiful thing.": "",
  "You arrive at the exit of this harrowing journey once more... this time, will you take it?": "",
  "The center of the Coremass, and the location of its heart.": "",
  "This is it - the center of the Soulplague Coremass. The faint light you've been seeing throughout your journey here doesn't seem so distant anymore... this must be the location of the heart.": "",
  "I can't believe we made it...": "",
  "You feel thoroughly exhausted, having made the grueling, fight-filled trek all the way here... but there's only one thing left to do. You know what you came here for.": "",
  "Head deeper.": "",
  "You travel a bit further, in search of the heart, and then notice something far off in the distance - the source of the Coremass' light, a beacon of multi-colored splendor most resplendent. Its visage is beautiful, almost ethereal, and you find yourself lost in awe as it whispers to you:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"...this place... isn't safe...\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"...it's... hunting for you...\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\"...you must... leave, before it's too late!\"": "",
  "These whispers are unlike any you've heard along the way here; they feel less hushed, and more... strained. Before you can think to act on these words of warning, though, a massive shadow looms into view...": "",
  "...revealing itself to be a Soulplague-infected ship, the size of which alone strikes fear into your heart. That's to speak nothing of its gargantuan eyes, which pierce your soul and seem to stare right through you, or its innumerable, writhing tentacles. An icon of voracity... as you stare at it in horror, new whispers worm their way into your mind:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"...drown... in our love...\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"...sink... in our embrace...\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"...we take sorrow... in your death...\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour death... is this the end?": "",
  "No, it's not... a Renegade makes their own fate.": "",
  "Rather than a flame, or a weapon, you find yourself clutching onto something else entirely... your hope. Your hope for existence; for life, and a brighter tomorrow - these ideals burn inside you, and you feel a kindred soul reach out to you from the vast sea of light and madness outside...": "",
  "Reach a hand out to it.": "",
  "You can't explain it, but you reach your hand out... and something unseen grabs ahold of it. Pulling back with all your strength, you watch as a tear in space forms around your hand, and grows, as a familiar figure reveals themself to be the one holding on... the armored woman you'd met earlier! You continue to pull, until she's free from the wormhole, and she crashes against the ground. Bringing herself to her feet, and brushing away some Soulplague-infected matter, she looks to you, her gauntlet over her heart, and speaks with resounding energy, \"A HERO, INDEED, COMRADE! I knew my faith in you wasn't ill-placed...\" she pauses to look outside, towards the horrific ship, and then back at you, \"...and it seems I'm not too late. The heart's guardian awaits; are you ready, comrade?\"": "",
  "Of course. I stand with you.": "",
  "She nods, and brandishes her spear, \"And I, with you! FORWARD, NOW - GLORY AWAITS! FOR HOPE, AND FOR THE MULTIVERSE!!!\" She runs off, deeper into the ship, and you prepare yourself... this is it. It's time to prove your convictions, or die trying!": "",
  "The Heroine": "",
  "Finally... is she here?": "",
  "As if to answer your tired question, a supernova breaks out in the space outside... and a familiar darkness fills the cavernous void, as a heroine appears. She has to have been aware of your malfeasance from the start, and lured you here... not exactly a hero's tactics. You feel her anger as she speaks to you through sheer will alone, \"Don't think for a second that I don't know what you are - what you've done. I may be a prisoner here, but you're something far more lowly: a prisoner to your own desires.\"": "",
  "And, you're what? Here to lecture me?": "",
  "She growls, \"I am here to stop you, fiend! Even the Coremass fears you... it would work with me, allow me the freedom to come here and fight you, all for the sake of its own well-being. I am willing to be a pawn to its schemes if it means you and your reign of terror die right here, right now.\"": "",
  "So be it, then, but... I think you'll find that your efforts are for naught.": "",
  "\"Then die a fool's death, as you engorge yourself on your own ego... for I will hold NOTHING back! BE CRUSHED UNDER HOPE'S BLADE, VILLAIN - AND KNOW THE PAIN YOU'D SO QUICKLY INFLICT UNTO OTHERS!\" There's a cry, as her ship flies towards your own... this is it. It's time to end this farce.": "",
  "Alas, there's nothing left.": "",
  "Indeed, it would seem there isn't. You've arrived at the exit of this harrowing journey once more... this time, will you take it?": "",
  "The infected drone's hull shatters, and the only choice you're left with is to salvage what remains.": "",
  "The drone halts to a stop, and then begins to careen its way over to you. As it gets close, though, some of the Soulplague goop encrusting it slacks off and melts into your ship's hull...": "",
  "...before finding its way inside and coalescing into a swarm of Husks!": "",
  "The drone halts to a stop, but the damage to its systems seems to be worse than you thought. It interprets your attempt at contact as a sign of aggression, and moves in to attack! As it gets close, some of the Soulplague goop encrusting it slacks off and melts into your ship's hull, ultimately forming a swarm of Soulplague Husks once inside... seems you've got double trouble!": "",
  "You're successfully able to get close enough to the drone to salvage it for parts, but it's difficult to account for the Soulplague-infected matter you bring back with you. The iridescent goop encrusting parts of the haul slacks off, and drops onto the floor... before coalescing into a swarm of Husks!": "",
  "Though you're able to get close to the drone, the damage to its systems doesn't seem to be as bad as you thought. It recognizes your attempt to salvage it as a sign of aggression, and prepares to defend itself! As it does so, some of the Soulplague goop encrusting it slacks off and melts into your ship's hull, ultimately forming a swarm of Soulplague Husks once inside... seems you've got double trouble!": "",
  "Now that the Husks have been dealt with, your attention returns to the drone outside. It seems to have been waiting nearby, patiently, and you notice as an automated voice recording is received from it, \"F-F-F... -DERATION! W-WELC-COME!\" You're not sure why it's all the way out here, or how it's managed to remain vaguely operational, but it seems to still have wares available for trade.": "",
  "It'd be a relief to see a familiar face all the way out here... and, yet, the Federation vessel that awaits you at this beacon is simply an Auto-ship. Worse yet, it seems to have suffered severe damage to its internal workings and external integrity as a result of the Soulplague mattervirus. The Auto-ship's hull glistens slightly, and its movements are sporadic, but you get the sense that you may be able to still trade with it if you could get it to slow down somehow.": "",
  "(Soulplague Crew) Fix the drone...?": "",
  "Your Soulplague-aligned crew member gurgles something, and you hear a faint whisper tinge against the edges of your mind. The Auto-ship outside halts to a stop, and an automated voice recording is received from it, \"F-F-F... -DERATION! W-WELC-COME!\" You're not sure why it's all the way out here, or how it's managed to remain vaguely operational, but it seems to still have wares available for trade.": "",
  "Your Engi is no stranger to working on Auto-ships and drones, though it's never seen one inflicted with a mattervirus. It's able to fix the drone enough to get it to stay still, but some of the Soulplague goop encrusting it slacks off and melts into your ship's hull...": "",
  "Your Engineer tries to explain that they're only used to working on Rebel Auto-ships, and never once Soulplague-infected ones, but you convince them to try anyways. They're able to fix the drone enough to get it to stay still, but some of the Soulplague goop encrusting it slacks off and melts into your ship's hull...": "",
  "Your repair drone begins to patch up the Auto-ship. It's able to fix it enough to get it to stay still, but some of the Soulplague goop encrusting it slacks off and melts into your ship's hull...": "",
  "Your Lanius is capable of salvaging the drone, knowing exactly what to disassemble to prevent triggering its defenses, but it wasn't prepared to account for the Soulplague-infected matter it'd bring with it. The iridescent goop encrusting parts of the haul slacks off, and drops onto the floor... before coalescing into a swarm of Husks!": "",
  "Ignore the Auto-ship.": "",
  "The malfunctioning automaton careens off, deeper into the nebula, and part of you wonders just how long it'll continue to wander aimlessly before its systems give out.": "",
  "What little had remained of the Federation ship goes flying in every direction, and is lost amongst the nebula's clouds.": "",
  "You make the call to investigate the inside of the tattered ship. To your surprise, there's somehow still power to its systems; a faint, stale breeze accompanies the ship's dimly lit halls. It doesn't take you long to figure out what happened to its previous occupants, though, as thick build-ups of the Soulplague mattervirus cake the walls, floor and ceiling... there's less 'ship' here than there is mattervirus. You make the desperate call to pull out, but it's already too late; the matter around you bubbles as Husks begin to pull themselves free from the walls around you. Thankfully, you're able to make it back to your own ship, but not without the Husks following!": "",
  "The final Husk melts into a puddle on the floor, and you return your attention to the Auto-ship hovering outside. You know it has enough energy to fulfill only one request. What will it be?": "",
  "Send a repair command.": "",
  "You send your command to the drone's systems, and it gets to repairing your ship's hull. It spends a few minutes doing so before its lights begin to flicker, and then die entirely as the Auto-ship goes still... its job is done. You hope it can rest easily out here in your fallen Federation allies' place.": "",
  "Send a command for resources.": "",
  "You send your command to the drone's systems, and it prepares to jettison its cargo. After doing so, its lights begin to flicker, and then die entirely as the Auto-ship goes still... its job is done. You hope it can rest easily out here in your fallen Federation allies' place.": "",
  "Send a command for it to distract the Rebel fleet.": "",
  "You send your command to the drone's systems, and it prepares to use the remainder of its energy to send out a Federation signal as powerful as it can muster. After doing so, its lights begin to flicker, and then die entirely as the Auto-ship goes still... its job is done. You hope it can rest easily out here in your fallen Federation allies' place.": "",
  "You press a button on the Auto-ship, and it roars to life... it'll deploy in a few moments, and you realize that you need to get out of here before it lifts off and tears a hole in the hull! You sprint through the wrecked ship's musty halls, the iridescent puddles around you reverberating as the drone prepares its takeoff, and you're able to make it back in time... as you do, the Auto-ship violently bursts free from the remains of the Federation ship. Its hull splinters, sending wreckage in every direction, and the Auto-ship hovers just outside...": "",
  "...but, it seems a horde of Husks woke up and followed you aboard just beforehand! You'll have to take care of them first...": "",
  "You press a button on the Auto-ship, and it roars to life... it'll deploy in a few moments, and you realize that you need to get out of here before it lifts off and tears a hole in the hull! You sprint through the wrecked ship's musty halls, the iridescent puddles around you reverberating as the drone prepares its takeoff, and you're able to make it back in time. You close the airlock behind you, and your ship decouples just as Soulplague Husks begin to pour out; they make a leap for it, but come just short... it seems they'll have all eternity to take out their ravenous energies on the nebula around them.": "",
  "Wait for the drone to launch.": "",
  "A few moments pass, and the Auto-ship violently bursts free from the remains of the Federation ship. Its hull splinters, sending wreckage in every direction, and the Auto-ship hovers just outside... you know it has enough energy to fulfill only one request. What will it be?": "",
  "You make the call to investigate the inside of the tattered ship. To your surprise, there's somehow still power to its systems; a faint, stale breeze accompanies the ship's dimly lit halls. Several puddles of the Soulplague mattervirus form patches across the floor, and you're able to surmise what happened to the ship's inhabitants... stepping around the mattervirus and heading deeper, though, you manage to stumble across the ship's hold. There's an undeployed Auto-ship within its remains, and you identify it as the source of the store beacon. Unfortunately, it seems that it was never properly stocked before its owners met their demise... it seems to have enough juice to only fulfill one task, even if you deployed it. To make matters worse, out of the corner of your eye, you notice as another puddle of the mattervirus glimmers in the darkness... is it worth risking its agitation?": "",
  "Activate the drone.": "",
  "Whatever little the Auto-ship could offer you isn't worth another battle with Husks. You make your way back to your ship, stepping carefully along the way, and are left to watch as the Federation wreck continues its slow, lonely drift through the nebula.": "",
  "The final Husk melts into a puddle on the floor, and you return your attention to the Auto-ship hovering outside. Before it begins its aimless journey through the nebula, you know that there's still time to trade with it. You do so with a heavy heart; one can only pray that the drone's journey here goes better than your fallen Federation allies' had.": "",
  "A few moments pass, and the Auto-ship violently bursts free from the remains of the Federation ship.

  "Any hope you had in your heart is quickly dispelled as you see the state of the Federation ship in the nebula outside. It looks like it's been here for years... there's little left of worth, if anything. Still, though, you know there's an active store beacon somewhere here...": "",
  "Inspect what remains of the ship.": "",
  "This smells of a trap, and a part of you is hesitant to disturb what has likely become several of your fellow soldiers' final resting place. You leave the tattered ship alone, and it continues its slow, lonely drift through the nebula.": "",
  "That'll show those jerks! Death to those who are rude, regardless of the circumstances! You're content with that, at least, as you recount the spoils of war and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "It's rare for a member of the Federation to consider a Dynasty ship to be a welcome face... but it sure beats another ship full of mindless Husks. Evidently, the feeling is mutual, as a Ghost hails, \"NEVER! Never had the thought crossed mine mind that it would be the sight of a BREATHER that lifts mine spirits... but the breathless here remain worse than ANY breather I've come to know. Pray tell, what brings thou to this nebulous hell?\"": "",
  "I could ask you the same thing.": "",
  "The Ghost scoffs, \"Was I supposed to ask THOU for thy permission? If thou must know, we came here demon-slaying... unknowing of the greater monsters lurking within. Our numbers dwindle from their vile assaults already; mine heart quivers at the thought of witnessing another fall, and another of these repulsive beasts being born.\" The air weighs heavy for a moment, before the Ghost continues, \"So it is for THAT reason that we tolerate your presence here, breather. Resources are tight, and we are to collect what we can to make our exit; we've brothers to mourn.\" The Dynasty ship opens their wares to you, if you can tolerate their insults.": "",
  "(Soulplague Crew) I can take being called a breather, but insulting my crew is another thing...": "",
  "A moment of confusion passes before your Soulplague-aligned crew member enters the room, and the Ghost on the other end of the call raises their voice, \"Thou would cohere with monsters?! Color me the fool for trusting one such as thyself... thy grave will be theirs, too!\" The Dynasty ship cuts communications, and their weapons come online!": "",
  "(Ghost Crew) \"Pray, hold thy harsh words!\"": "",
  "Your Ghost calls out from behind you, and the one on the other end of the call steps back a little, \"Why, do mine ears deceive me? A breather would house our kind? And as equals, no less... this hell holds surprises, yet! Resources may be scarce, yes, but what is scarcer amongst a sea of monsters than kinship? Allow us to celebrate!\" The two Ghosts hit it off, and you're sent a commemorative gift before the Dynasty ship opens their wares to you. They never did take back the whole 'breather' thing, though...": "",
  "Bite your tongue, and prepare to trade.": "",
  "You'd sooner bite your tongue than the hand that feeds you... Ghosts they may be, there're much worse and much more literal undead lurking about. You'll take what you can get.": "",
  "Nah, screw that. Kill this guy.": "",
  "If they were so invested in their own survival they wouldn't be going around insulting good, hard-working people. You prepare to put in more of that hard work as you cut communications and ready your weapons, as the Dynasty ship does the same!": "",
  "As the Slug's ship smolders and its hull is inches away from buckling, you receive a desperate hail, \"WAIT! Maybe you can handle yoursssself after all. Maybe it'ssss not ME who issss mercccy, but you?\"": "",
  "Relent. You are mercy.": "",
  "You spare the Slugs, and are able to deal with what remains of the Soulplague Husks.

  "A Slug ship lurks within the nebula nearby, a sight that would normally instill fear into the captain of any ship... but you're mostly just praying that it isn't another Husk-infested vessel.

I ssstill have a choiccce... and I'm not letting them take a sssingle other ssssoul into their twisssted army! I AM DELIVERANCCCCE! I AM MERCCCY!\" Piles of Soulplague-infected goop meld through the ceiling before rising up as a small army of Soulplague Husks, and the Slug ship makes an offensive advance towards your own!": "",
  "Listen to the Slug and get away.": "",
  "You end communications and put a signifcant amount of distance between you and the crazed Slug. Their ship fades away into the murky depths of the nebula, and you're left wondering what their deal was.": "",
  "With the Slug ship destroyed, it's needless to say that there won't be any trading done here... oh well. It's time to move on.": "",
  "You jump in your seat as you enter the beacon and are immediately SPAMMED with the sound of dozens of requests to hail, and your gaze meets the Slug ship in the nebula outside. At least you can be confident that they aren't Husks, but this is still odd behavior.": "",
  "Answer one of the many requests to hail.": "",
  "Hailing the Slugs, you jump in your seat again as the video feed connects and you're met with the visage of a Slug with its face right up against the camera. They speak, hastily, \"You're not one of thosssse zzzombie thingssss, right? Right? PROVE IT! TURN AROUND!\"": "",
  "Indulge the Slug, and turn around.": "",
  "You turn around, and hear the Slug on the screen behind you calm down slightly, \"Okay, okay- you're legit. GODSSSS. Thissss placccce SSSUCKSSS. Can't trusssst anybody! It'ssss jusssst like back home.\" They sigh, and you turn back around, \"Look, we sssshould really be getting out of here. You need anything, I'd make it quick. FASSSST. Pleasssse. I. Am. TIRED of thissss sssstupid placcce...\" The Slug gets through their exasperated sentence, and you're allowed a few moments to shop around and do something on the ship.": "",
  "You turn around, and hear as the Slug on the screen behind you screams, \"I KNEW IT! YOU CAN'T FOOL ME, ZZZZOMBIE SSSSCUM! SSSSUCK IT!\" They cut communications, their weapons charging, and you wipe a cloth against your back... it seems your Soulplague-aligned crew member got some goop on your back earlier. Oops... well, prepare for battle!": "",
  "I'm not turning around.": "",
  "You stand still, stalwart, and the Slug screams, \"THAT'SSSS WHAT A ZZZZOMBIE WOULD SSSSAY! YOU CAN'T FOOL ME, ZZZZOMBIE SSSSCUM! SSSSUCK IT!\" They cut communications, and their weapons come online... do you really give off zombie vibes?": "",
  "Attack the Slugs, for being annoying.": "",
  "Honestly, you're doing this reality a service by removing these spam-hailers from it. As soon as they recognize that your intentions are aggressive, the requests to hail stop, and their weapons come online!": "",
  "Ignore the Slugs' incessant amount of spam.": "",
  "You're content ignoring the Slugs and minding your own business, but it seems they have other plans... realizing you're ignoring their hails, their weapons come online, and they move to attack! You're not sure if it was a trick from the get-go, or if they're just really paranoid, but you're prepared to defend yourself regardless.": "",
  "With the Deep Ones defeated, a part of your soul aches... did it really have to be this way? Yes. It did. That's what you'll tell yourself, at least, even if it's only so you can live with yourself a little easier.": "",
  "...the Deep Ones are ecstatic. They circle around it, doing a dance of sorts:\n\t\n\t\"We're... saved! We're saved!\"\n\t\"Truly, the Dark One works... in mysterious ways!\"\n\t\"This was... its intention all along!\"\n\t\n\tEventually, the original one you'd been speaking with turns to the other two, \"Me, and the others... will return home with this blessing... in tow. I would ask... that you two escort our lord's deliverer... through this wasteland.\" The two Deep Ones nod, and the other turns to you, \"I spare you... some of our kin, and... what resources we can muster up. Please, trade... if you so wish. We are... eternally grateful to you, o' Federation.\" The first of the Deep Ones then makes their way over...": "",
  "...then the second one...": "",
  "...and then everything they've deemed that they can spare. While the two Deep Ones acquaint themselves with your crew, the others implore you to browse their remaining stock.": "",
  "Let's shop, then!": "",
  "Attracted by the store beacon, you enter a clearing in the nebula and are faced with a Deep One ship. Unsure if its been overtaken by the mattervirus or not, you watch its movements at a distance, but it seems to be equally as wary of you as you are of it.": "",
  "Attempt to hail the ship.": "",
  "You're able to do so, and you feel your anxiety wash away as a living, breathing Deep One appears on the screen, \"Federation... here? Has the beacon... worked, then? Are... we saved?\"": "",
  "Saved? What am I meant to do?": "",
  "The Deep One shifts a little, awkwardly, \"We've... been low on raw resources for... quite some time. Usually, we'd... consider ourselves experts at... making use of old, abandoned materials, but... this 'Soulplague' madness... seems to have ruined nearly everything. We'd... like to leave as soon as possible, but... lack the resources for the journey.\"": "",
  "Why did you come here in the first place?": "",
  "There's another change in their demeanor, but this one comes off less as being awkward and more as being defensive. Secretive. \"That... is hardly your concern. We... had our reasons for coming here. To this... damnable place...\" There's a brutal silence for a moment, before the Deep One clears their throat and continues, \"So... are you interested in trade, or not?\"": "",
  "(Deep One Crew) \"Kin... something troubles you.\"": "",
  "You're watching this Deep One switch through stances and demeanors like they're spamming emotes in a video game. They hear your Deep One speak, and their shoulders drop as they instantly lose their composure, \"Kin... here? Aboard a Federation vessel... of all places... indeed, we are troubled. We... were sent here to retrieve an artifact, from... our lord. We've... failed in our mission, and, yet... it is the wrath of this sector we fear more... than any divine punishment. Our fate feels... sealed, regardless.\" There's a gloom in the air, as the Deep One stares longingly at the floor.": "",
  "(Darkness Weaponry) Is this what you're looking for?": "",
  "Their eyes light up as you point to your weapon of darkness, \"You... would house one of our lord's gifts? You... truly are extraordinary. Yes, indeed... it is. Would you... be wiling to part with it? We... would reward you handsomely, with... everything we can spare.\"": "",
  "Give them your dark Flak weapon.": "",
  "You send the weapon over, and...": "",
  "Give them your dark Light Laser weapon.": "",
  "Give them your dark Bomb weapon.": "",
  "Give them your dark Beam weapon.": "",
  "Give them your dark Charge Laser weapon.": "",
  "No, sorry. I'll keep it.": "",
  "Anger burns in the Deep One's eyes, \"Then, why... bring it up? No matter... forgive me, kin, but... we need this. We... cannot fail our lord.\" They cut communications, and their weapons come online! It seems they mean to take the weapon by force.": "",
  "(Darkness Drone) Is this what you're looking for?": "",
  "Their eyes light up as you point to your drone of darkness, \"You... would house one of our lord's gifts? You... truly are extraordinary. Yes, indeed... it is. Would you... be wiling to part with it? We... would reward you handsomely, with... everything we can spare.\"": "",
  "Give them your dark Combat drone.": "",
  "You send the drone over, and...": "",

  "Give them your dark Utility drone.": "",
  "Anger burns in the Deep One's eyes, \"Then, why... bring it up? No matter... forgive me, kin, but... we need this. We... cannot fail our lord.\" They cut communications, and their weapons come online! It seems they mean to take the drone by force.": "",
  "I see... I'm sorry to hear that.": "",
  "You offer your condolences, and the Deep One picks themselves up a bit, \"We'll... figure it out. I'm... sure. In any case, allow us... to trade goods.\" The Deep Ones show you their goods, and you're free to look around.": "",
  "Sure. Let's trade, then.": "",
  "There's relief in their expression, but you sense that something is troubling them. Regardless of what it is, though, it isn't any of your business. The Deep Ones show you their goods, and you're free to look around.": "",
  "I'm going to blow you up.": "",
  "\"You're... what?\" Rather than answering verbally, you cut communications, preparing to answer much more violently... and the Deep Ones get ready to defend themselves!": "",
  "Nah. You're up to something.": "",
  "You not-so-politely decline the Deep Ones' offer of trade and end communications before they can respond. After putting a bit of distance between you and them, you feel comfortable waiting around as the FTL charges.": "",
  "Honestly, you don't care why they're here, if they're Husks, or if they're Deep Ones. You just want to blow something up. The opposing ship recognizes your aggression, and prepares to defend itself!": "",
  "You're content continuing to keep your distance. The Deep One ship does the same, and you're left alone as you wait for the FTL to charge.": "",
  "This time, the next message comes back quickly:\n\t\n\tEPSILON\n\t\n\tThat's all that's written. This time, there's no way to respond back.": "",
  "What? Who? Why? Where? When?": "",
  "You're pondering life's greatest questions as a flash of light outside your ship startles you back to reality; the outpost explodes, a cascading eruption of individual bombs that sends debris flying in every direction, and you're only narrowly able to avoid it... or so you thought. Among the debris is a ludicrous amount of Soulplague-infected matter, the iridescent material splintered into thousands of tiny droplets as it soars through space. Many of them splatter against your ship, and it only takes seconds for them to meld together and into the hull of your ship... you're not sure what in the hell just happened, but you know you've got company!": "",
  "At first, you wonder if you're hallucinating as you enter a clearing in the nebula, but you quickly realize what you're seeing is in fact real... there's an entire Shell outpost at this store beacon, and it seems to actually be maintained! As you approach, though, several massive armaments installed into it take aim at your ship... how do you respond?": "",
  "Halt your approach.": "",
  "You stop the ship, and the outpost's oversized weapons don't take fire. They don't avert their aim, either, but at least they're hesitating on blowing you to smithereens. To your confusion, it's not a hail you receive, but a direct message to your ship's systems:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFEDERATION\n\t\t\tWHAT\n\t\t\tNEED\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThere's a single-word prompt underneath the message, ready for a response.": "",

  "Huh. Weird. Let's trade, then! No questions asked!": "",
  "Nope. Don't trust that. Get out of here.": "",
  "As your ship pulls away, the outpost's weapons remain locked on, but they still don't fire. You're in the clear as your systems receive one final message, and you shudder in response:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHERO\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSEE\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYOU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSOON": "",

You dodge out of the way as it falls, ready to sound the alarm as its mass forms into a Soulplague Husk, but it simply... stands there. You blink, and its face reverberates. You wave an arm, and its corresponding arm splits into three. You're not sure why, but it seems to be... friendly? There's the undeniable feeling that you've yet to grasp this outpost's true nature, but you're not about to risk being blown to hell to do so.

  "There's a flash of light, and a few crates of resources inexplicably appear in the room beside you. More inexplicable is the state of the crates... they're almost crawling with Soulplague-infected matter.

  "Type in 'REPAIRS'.": "",

  "What ARE you doing in a place like this?": "",
  "The Shell rolls back a bit, and you're able to observe that they're a member of the Geniocracy's Science District, \"Truth be told, I'm here against thhhhe Chief's orders... he and Nerva were really insistent thhhhat nobody came out here after Epsilon went off thhhhe grid. I'm here because I'm curious, more thhhhan anythhhhing, but it really looks like I'm in over my head withhh thhhhis one...\"": "",
  "Chief?": "",

I don't even know your name, but I sure as hell will when thhhhis whole mess is over. I'd dust off your resume, if I were you; but thhhhank science I'm not!\" He rolls away, snickering to himself, and the Shell looks completely disheartened...": "",
  "You know... the Federation's always hiring.": "",
  "They roll closer, perking up at that, \"Are... you implying what I thhhhink you're implying?\" You nod, and the Shell breathes a huge sigh of relief, \"Thhhhat makes me Alkali's equal, right? While he's onboard, anyways. He'll HATE thhhhat.\" They snicker, reminiscent of Alkali's own just seconds prior, \"Shows him. Douchebag. While I'm heading on over, thhhough, feel free to trade withhhh my associate!\" The Shell rolls out of the room, appearing on your ship moments later...": "",
  "Yeah, screw you Alkali! Store time!": "",

  "About that store beacon...": "",
  "The Shell perks up, \"Yeah! I've got a bit I can offer you, before I high-tail it out of here. Take a look!\" The Shell steps back, revealing their stock, and you're allowed to trade.": "",
  "You make your way past what remains of the Husks' ship, and promptly hail the nearby Shells, but you realize something's wrong as you do so... their ship's moving just as sporadically. That store beacon must've been a trap, if these monsters are capable of such a thing... or just something left behind by the ship's prior owners. You do your best to get away, but not before some of the ship's Husks force their way onboard!": "",
  "A ship whizzes past you as you arrive at the store beacon, and you recognize its almost random movements... and, you recognize its target! A ship full of Husks is headed straight for the Shell ship just ahead!": "",
  "Intervene. Protect the trader!": "",
  "You rush ahead of the Husk-infested ship, able to get a lead on it as it zigs and zags, and prepare to stop its advance!": "",
  "Leave the Shells to their fate.": "",
  "This isn't a fight you wish to take. As much as it pains you, you turn away from the Shells and pretend to be ignorant to their plight.": "",
  "You do everything in your power to maneuver through the Soulplague goop outside, but one wrong move results in your ship bumping against one of the piles of infected matter...": "",
  "and it cascades, bumping into and agitating several more! They bubble, squirming angrily, before burrowing into the hull of your ship and coalescing into a small army of Soulplague Husks!": "",
  "...it bubbles, squirming angrily, before burrowing into the hull of your ship and coalescing into a group of Soulplague Husks!": "",
  "You do everything in your power to maneuver through the Soulplague goop outside, and, to your surprise, are successfully able to reach the cache without disturbing any of the infected matter. Now that you're close to it, you realize the cache itself has also been devasted by the mattervirus... is it still worth taking aboard?": "",
  "The cache is brought inside, through the airlock, and its walls writhe as the mattervirus is agitated...": "",
  "...prepare yourself!": "",
  "Leave the cache alone.": "",
  "This isn't worth it, after all... you leave the cache alone and do your best to keep the ship still as you make preparations to leave the beacon.": "",
  "With the Husks defeated, you're able to continue your trek to the cache. Thankfully, the rest of it goes smoother, but now that you're close to the cache you realize it's also been devasted by the mattervirus... is it still worth taking aboard?": "",
  "As the final intruder melts into yet another puddle of harmless, deactivated matter, you're able to peer inside what remains of the cache... and see a weapon, itself completely overtaken by the Soulplague mattervirus. In this state, though, it's useful to you; just remember to scrub your hull down later... with fire.": "",
  "The nebulous space here seems to be absolutely infested with Soulplague-infected matter, its colorful yet sickly sheen subtly sparkling even amongst the clouds. It's yet to be agitated by your presence, and you're almost content just staying still until the FTL charges, but then you spot a cache floating in the distance... there's no telling what's inside of it, but it's yours if you can get to it.": "",
  "(Soulplague Crew) Have your crew member soothe the infected matter outside.": "",
  "A faint whisper rings out from your Soulplague-aligned crew member, touching both your mind and the Soulplague goop outside, and you understand that a path has been paved ahead. You carve through the scattered blobs in the space outside, quickly reaching the cache without having them so much as squirm. Now that you're close to it, you realize the cache itself has also been devasted by the mattervirus... you're not sure your crew member can help you if you bring it aboard.": "",
  "(Upg. Engines) Navigate through the infected matter outside carefully.": "",
  "Your engines prove powerful enough for you to maneuver your way through the metaphorical minefield outside, quickly reaching the cache without disturbing any of the infected matter. Now that you're close to it, you realize the cache itself has also been devasted by the mattervirus... is it still worth taking aboard?": "",
  "The cache is brought inside, through the airlock, and its walls writhe as the mattervirus is agitated... prepare yourself!": "",
  "Try your best to reach the cache.": "",
  "Ignore the cache, and stay still.": "",
  "This is way too much of a risk, especially when you have no idea if there's even anything of value in that cache. Content with your decision to stay safe, you do your best to keep the ship still as you make preparations to leave the beacon.": "",
  "Indeed, you're able to collect plenty of scrap uncontested. New glimmers catch your attention outside, though, as you realize some of the debris outside is infected after all... you might be pushing your luck if you collect any more of it.": "",
  "It'll be fine. Keep going!": "",
  "Let's not get too greedy.": "",
  "You decide it's best to avoid the risk of having to deal with more Soulplague Husks, and leave the rest of the debris alone.": "",
  "Not a moment passes before you start collecting the scrap outside... and realize you've made a mistake in your haste. The first bit of scrap that's touched wriggles furiously, its iridescent tentacles stretching outward and sending the rest of the debris flying into the nebula; then, it attacks your ship, revealing itself to have been a melted amalgamate of Soulplague Husks the entire time! Looks like this wasn't the payday you were expecting...": "",
  "It seems you're not unlucky as you continue filling your coffers, successfully avoiding agitating any of the Soulplague-infected matter outside. Plenty remains, but staying any longer risks not only the wrath of any Soulplague Husks lying in wait, but that of the Rebel fleet as well... what will you do?": "",
  "I was born to take risks! KEEP! GOING!": "",
  "This is enough. I'm ready to get out of here.": "",
  "You decide it's best to avoid the risk of having to deal with either Soulplague Husks or the Rebellion, and leave the rest of the debris alone.": "",
  "You're not so lucky this time... you try to collect more of the scrap outside, but one of the pieces wriggles as it's touched, its iridescent tentacles stretching outward and sending the rest of the debris flying into the nebula; then, it attacks your ship, revealing itself to have been a melted amalgamate of Soulplague Husks the entire time! You can't say you're surprised, but it's still unfortunate...": "",
  "Some time passes, and you realize you've done it... you've picked this damn place clean. The only debris that remains outside is that which looks infected, and you're not THAT greedy. Or... are you?": "",
  "Of course I'm that greedy. Take the scrap! TAKE IT ALL!": "",
  "Before anybody can stop you, you maneuver to collect some of the Soulplague-infected scrap outside... and it wriggles as it's touched, its iridescent tentacles stretching outward and agitating other pieces that continue to do the same. You've triggered the wrath of an entire swarm of Soulplague Husks!": "",
  "I may be greedy, but what worth is scrap if I'm dead? Leave the infected matter alone.": "",
  "There's no point in taking it, right? Right...?": "",
  "Right?": "",
  "...take it... right... take us...": "",
  "Right... I'll take it...": "",
  "You snap out of your daze right before disturbing a piece of the Soulplague-infected scrap outside. What was that? You felt like... something was whispering inside your head. Compelling you to listen to your greed... are you going insane? At the very least, you snapped out of it, and are disturbed by whispers no further as you prepare to jump out of the beacon.": "",
  "You're not so lucky this time... you try to collect more of the scrap outside, but one of the pieces wriggles as it's touched, its iridescent tentacles stretching outward and agitating other pieces that continue to do the same. You've triggered the wrath of an entire swarm of Soulplague Husks, AND the Rebels are encroaching! What remains of the untainted scrap outside is sent flying away, deeper into the nebula, as it's whipped... dammit.": "",
  "You catch a glimpse of something shimmering in the space outside, and you assume it to simply be yet another hunk of Soulplague-infected matter... but you realize it's so much more. There's an entire field of debris here!": "",
  "(Scrap Arm) Oh, hell yes. Let's REALLY collect some scrap!": "",
  "(Magnetic Arm) Oh, hell yes. Let's REALLY collect some scrap!": "",
  "Oh, hell yeah! Let's collect some scrap!": "",
  "Oh, hell no! Leave the scrap alone.": "",
  "You don't trust this field of debris... what in this sector ISN'T corrupted by the mattervirus at this point? Unwilling to risk the lives of those aboard for some measly scrap, you do your best to leave the debris undisturbed.": "",
  "Once you're close enough to them, the Ghost makes a leap and phases through the airlock. After they're given a moment to compose themself, they explain that they've only been stranded here for a few days at worst. Apparently, an infection from the Soulplague mattervirus had begun to run rampant through their ship, slowly corrupting it and the Ghosts aboard. This one opted to leave before things got too bad, and has been stuck floating through the nebula ever since... until now! Indebted to you, they offer to join your crew and get out of this madness together.": "",
  "Once you're close enough to them, the Ghost makes a leap and phases through the airlock. After they're aboard, though, their gaseous form begins to... shift. Evaporate. You watch in horror as the Ghost dies before you, and colorful particles begin to condensate within the space where they stood. These particles fall to the ground as they form, eventually forming an entire puddle of what you recognize to be Soulplague-infected matter. From this puddle rises a Soulplague Husk, its form a mockery of the Ghost who'd just died. It stands there, and you think to act...": "",
  "You shoot at the Husk, and its body warps its shape to dodge the attack... it seems you've angered it!": "",
  "Wait for the Husk to make its move.": "",
  "You wait, hesitant to act first, and the Husk continues to simply stand there. Eventually, it lets out a strange, gurgling noise, before walking away into another room... your crew all avoid its path, but it doesn't seem interested in them either. Is this a friendly Husk, then...? Your new, tentacled companion engulfs a spoon into its torso whole, and you're left to wonder what causes some of these monsters to be docile and impressionable.": "",
  "Once you're close enough to them, you expect the Ghost to make a leap for it, but instead they just... stand there. Before you can catch on, the metallic disk underneath them explodes into a colorful mess of Soulplague-infected matter, killing the Ghost and splattering iridescent goop against the side of your hull.

  "Get closer to the Ghost.": "",
  "You do so, and something else catches your eye... the disk the Ghost is sitting atop of looks like it's been partially infected by the Soulplague mattervirus. You look at them again, and recognize that there's a desperation in their movements. That's normal, seeming that it looks like they've been stranded, but the situation still makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable...": "",

  "You almost crash into a ship as you fly into the beacon... or, so you think at first glance.

It's certainly deserving of such adoration...": "",
  "Moving out of the room, into a hallway and deeper into the ship leads to a central room much larger than the one prior, but one still full of similar objects.

  "I'm good, I suppose. Good luck out there!": "",
  "The Clansman doesn't say anything back, instead opting to swiftly end communications and return to their skulking amongst the clouds. Rude, sure, but at least it beats another Husk ship having been here...": "",
  "While you were dealing with the Husks, it seems the other Dynasty ship has vanished amongst the clouds. You don't suppose they'll be thanking you...": "",
  "Now that you've apprehended the Husks that pursued them, the Dynasty ship gives you a weapon from their coffers as a token of their appreciation. The Ghosts explain that they were here in response to a series of Dynasty distress calls emanating from the sector, only to be swarmed by several ships of Husks. Apparently, they managed to escape from most of them, but this one had been giving them a particular amount of trouble... now that they're no longer being chased, they insist that they leave and report back what horrors they've seen immediately. You're not one to argue, since you've already gotten your reward, so the Dynasty ship jumps out of the beacon without a second thought and you're left alone with the spoils of war.": "",
  "There's no sign of the second ship, and you realize its entire crew of Husks must've boarded, leaving 'their' ship to soar off into the clouds outside... devious indeed, but you've made it out alive.": "",

  "Sure, I'll help! Fall back and intercept the Husks.": "",
  "You lag behind the Dynasty ship slightly, and the other one zigzags into view... as you loom nearby, you draw their attention, becoming the focus of their erratic ire!": "",
  "I think I'll just kill you myself, actually.": "",
  "\"It would seem mine judgment rang hollow; thy aren't pure at all! Thy may be not foul of body, but thine heart remains as grotesque as that of any demon. En garde, fiend!\" The Dynasty ship cuts communications, and the two of you prepare to engage in combat before the Husks can catch up.": "",
  "Nah, I came here to watch.": "",
  "\"Thy... what? Then, may thine distraction prove sufficient!\" The Dynasty ship speeds up, out of view, and you're left bewildered as the Husk ship catches up behind you... you've been made useful, whether you wanted to be or not!": "",
  "...but you realize something is off about their movements, as well. These are both Husk ships! Before you can realize your mistake and break away, the second ship speeds in from behind, engaging to board, while the one ahead readies its weapons... was this a trap?! Are Husks that intelligent...?": "",
  "A Dynasty ship soars past you, vanishing into the clouds outside, and then a second does the same moments later; its movements being noticeably... wobblier. Have Soulplague Husks overran a Dynasty ship, and begun chasing others down?": "",
  "Chase after the first ship.": "",
  "The engines roar to life, and they give you all they've got in order to catch up to the two ships. You're able to get a lead over the Husk ship, and approach the Dynasty ship in front of it...": "",
  "Chase after the second ship.": "",
  "The engines roar to life, and they give you all they've got in order to catch up to the two ships. Cutting off the wobblier one, you're able to grab its attention and allow the Dynasty ship to escape... Husks, incoming!": "",
  "Leave the two ships to their chase.": "",
  "While your heart goes out to the Dynasty ship, you're not necessarily interested in putting your life on the line for the sake of theirs right now. You make no effort to chase either of the two ships as they sink deeper into the nebula, and are left alone as the FTL charges.": "",
  "As you gather your spoils, you're left with more questions than answers; why were Husks sitting here, seemingly waiting patiently, and what were those whispers you had heard? They'd felt... assuring. Comforting, like you'd believe their words regardless of the reality before you. You shudder at the thought of being mind controlled, but you understand that whatever occurred just now felt different compared to the effects of the system. You weren't controlled, as much as you were... hazy. Given little to go off of, you're forced to ponder these many mysteries as you gather up the last of the ominous ship's valuables and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "\"...nothing here... alone... quiet silence...\"": "",
  "(Soulplague Crew) \"...\"": "",
  "Your Soulplague-aligned crew member silently bores their way into your mind, counteracting whatever whispering voice you heard just now, and you're snapped out of a trance... coming to, you realize in the clouds outside is a ship, simply floating there. Before you can really gather your senses, it comes to life, making a hostile approach!": "",
  "You'll lose the Clairvoyants amongst the nebula's clouds if you can't defeat the Husk ship before the time runs out.": "",
  "Catching up with the Clairvoyants' ship, they hail as you approach, and a Slug Clairvoyant annoyedly speaks with you, \"Yessss, thank you, your Sssaintlinesss, but we besssst be on our way. Toodlesss!\" They reach down to press a button, and end the call...": "",
  "Wait! Can't we at least talk?": "",

  "Answers, mainly. What are the Clairvoyants doing out here?": "",

The Saboteur follows suit, and, moments later, you find that they've beamed on board! Let's see if you can make it out of this hell, indeed...": "",
  "Kaiser": "",
  "I'll pass. Good luck on your journey!": "",
  "Somewhat disappointed with your answer, the Saboteur accepts it nonetheless and leaves the beacon aboard the Clairvoyant ship.": "",

  "You are literally a Slug.": "",
  "The Clairvoyant puffs up their slimy chest, \"And YOU are literally a racccisst!

  "Is there something wrong with small talk...?": "",
  "You don't get a response before the Clairvoyant ends the call, leaving you alone and, indeed, incredibly small-talkless.": "",
  "Indeed, they end the call and proceed to escape deeper into the nebula. You're not sure what you were expecting... maybe you just wanted to be alone, deep down.": "",
  "Their distress beacon goes offline, and you understand that the Clairvoyants' ship will now be impossible to find with the lead they've gained. To make matters worse, the Husk ship jumps away, seemingly now disinterested in you... or, are they simply after the Clairvoyants?

  "With everything collected, you realize you haven't seen the Husk ship in quite some time... then, before you can react, it whizzes past; its zombie-like crew jumping ship and boarding yours as it does so! Looks like you got a bit too comfy...": "",
  "You realize the distress beacon's source to be a Slug Clairvoyant, their ship darting amongst the clouds as a second ship follows in not-so-hot pursuit... they must be being chased by Husks.

  "(Nights) \"Hah, sssshowsss them!\"": "",
  "Nights chugs one back, drinking the entire bottle's contents before slamming it against the floor and raising a tentacle up in a way you can only assume is provocative, \"Your ssstupid traditionssss aren't so ussseful out here, are they? Thissss isss PIRATE territory, moronsss!\"": "",
  "Uh... and where are your Knights, Nights? If anything, this seems like Husk territory.": "",

  "Save the Clairvoyant ship.": "",
  "Putting yourself in-between the two ships as they dart back and forth, you're easily able to pull the Husk ship's attention. The Clairvoyant ship seems to slow its pace slightly as you intervene, but they must be too wary to trust you entirely; you'll have to make this quick if you'd like a chance to talk with them before they vanish within the deeper depths of the nebula.": "",
  "Attack the Clairvoyant ship yourself.": "",
  "Much more direct with your approach, you're able to catch up with the Clairvoyant ship while the Husks still lag behind.

  "Look for that Shell scientist.": "",
  "You find the Shell scientist and ask them to explain what happened, and why they're here. Though they're still on edge, they try their best to answer your questions, \"I... don't know why I let thhhhem convince me to come! I had a bad feeling about thhhis from thhhhe start!

  "Approaching the sound's source, it gets a little clearer; it's the wheezing of a pained Shell.

  "With their Military District on strike, it's rare to see the Geniocracy's militant vessels out and about in their own sectors, let alone in an abandoned region as barren as this one.

  "Let's board them, maybe? They might need help...": "",

  "This whole situation is fishy, and you can't afford to brave the toxins of a Shell ship knowing other potential dangers may be lurking onboard. Though you aren't satisfied, you feel it necessary to leave the ship alone and wait until you can jump away.": "",
  "I know how to get their attention. Attack!": "",
  "Even as you assault them, the Shells make no effort to defend themselves. It's odd, seeing how their ship was still powered, but you figure that you must've been too late to save them in the first place. Regardless, you're left to scrap what little remains of their wreck.": "",
  "Gathering these bits of scrap, though, you realize something's off. Some of it appears oily, and iridescent... this ship must have been Soulplague-infected! Before you can correct your mistake of salvaging it, some of the scrap oozes, and bubbles, and a small horde of Husks rises forth to make you their next victim!": "",
  "How rude! I'll ignore them back, then.": "",
  "The gall of some aliens, you swear... you put your INCREDIBLY urgent mission to quite literally SAVE REALITY on hold, purely to address their distress call, and they can't even muster up the energy to answer your hails?

  "I don't trust this. Leave the ship alone.": "",
  "This whole sector's got you on edge, and you're not about to let any more Husks get the jump on you. You don't trust these Shells for a second. Leaving the ship alone, it leaves you alone in turn, and you're able to wait until you can jump away.": "",
  "You're going to have to explain the destruction of their ship to the Slug... at the very least, you can spend a few moments scrapping it before you do.": "",
  "Call the Slug back.": "",
  "The slime pool's volume has risen slightly since you last called them, and the Slug answers eagerly, \"YOU'RE ALIVE! Sssso, you ssshowed them what'ssss for, huh? Cleaned them out?\"": "",
  "Well, yes, but, I, uh... may have destroyed your ship.": "",
  "You're expecting more emotion, but the Slug remains surprisingly calm, \"Aw, sssshit. Well, it'ssss whatever. I kinda lied about it being my sssship, anywaysss. Wassss mosstly jussst bumming a ride.\" The Slug stews in their own slime for a moment, thinking, and then they look back at you, \"Ssssay, you're on a ssship, aren't you? A ssship with... room for one sssuch asss mysssself, mayhapsss?\"": "",
  "Uh...": "",
  "They cut you off, \"Great! I'll ssssit right here while you hurry on over, then! Not that I can, er, do anything elssse in here.\" You sigh, and decide there're worse things than free crew members as you bring the Slug's pod aboard... just, be mindful of the slime, yeah?": "",
  "Slimelord": "",
  "Leave the Slug to its fate.": "",
  "You're, like, REALLY uncomfortable with confrontations. So uncomfortable, in fact, that you'd sooner let someone drown in a pool of their own slime drifting in a pod through space than break some bad news to them. This is why you're tasked with saving reality, and not something more difficult, like public relations...": "",
  "With the ship emptied of Husks, you call the Slug back and tell them the news, \"Ssssee, I knew I could trussst the Federattttion! Not that I had too many, er, choicccesss in the matter. Give me a ride back to my sssship, yeah?\"": "",
  "Do as the Slug asks.": "",
  "You're able to locate their pod, and bring them back to the Slug ship with little hassle. Once they're settled inside, they hail you again, \"Oh, SSSSHIT isss thiss placcce sspaciousss with everyone gone. Ssssay, you ssscratched my back; how about I sssscratch yoursss? With everyone elssse dead, I don't ssssee why you can't have sssome of their ssstuff. SSSSOME, though! A Ssslug'ss gotta eat!\" The Slug beams a rather large bounty over, and you realize among the various resources is a strange weapon... one infected by the Soulplague mattervirus!": "",
  "What's the meaning of this?": "",
  "The Slug looks over, \"Oh, that? Everyone wassss obsssesssing over that thing thisss morning. Found it floating out in sssspace. Funny thing isss, that'ssss the lassst thing I can remember doing before thissss zzzombie ssshit hit the fan... you don't think they're related, do you?\"": "",
  "\"Yeah, it'ssss probably jusst a coincccidencce. Anywho, thanksss again! I've gotta figure out how to, uh, get out of thissss placcce...\" The Slug looks at the ship's controls, confused, you reckon, before slamming a button at random and jumping out of the beacon. You have full confidence in their ability to navigate their way out of this hell.": "",
  "Honestly, you can't really justify this one. You just don't really like this guy. You end the call without another word, and take some time to salvage what you can from their ship.": "",
  "You spot an idle Slug ship and are hailed as you enter the beacon, but you quickly realize said hail is originating from a location slightly past the ship, obscured by the nebula. Odd...": "",
  "Answer the mysterious hail.": "",
  "It's an incredibly claustrophobic sight that you're greeted with, as a Slug sits with its face practically pressed against the screen. Whatever room it's sitting in comes off as more of a jail cell, with each of its walls mere inches away from the Slug as it speaks, \"THANK GOODNESSSSS! I thought my heroic sssavior sssenssesss were tingling! I'm in an ESSSCAPE POD right now, a little waysss away, trying to keep myssself sssafe after thesssse oily BASSSSTARDSS hijacked my sssship!\" The camera moves slightly, and you get a view of the pod's lower region; this Slug is practically swimming in its own slime.": "",
  "How long have you, uh... been in there?": "",
  "The Slug shakes the camera, \"Doesss that MATTER? Give a Sssslug a helping tentacle and deal with thosssse thingsss, will you? Or, like, a hand? WHATEVER YOU HAVE! IT SSSSMELLSSS IN HERE! I can't take another SSSSECOND!\"": "",
  "Alright, alright. I'll clear your ship out.": "",
  "\"Ssssee, I've alwaysss known you Federatttion guyssss were awessssome! Alwaysss loved them!\" Right... well, regardless of the Slug's glazing, you move in to deal with the Husks aboard their ship. As you make your approach, the Slug's ship shifts slightly, tensing for a moment before making a jittery approach of its own!": "",
  "What's in it for me?": "",
  "\"Ugh, you ssssound like my exxxx. I dunno, my thankssss? Aren't you Federatttion typessss powered by love and rainbowsss, or ssssome ssshit?\"": "",
  "I do enjoy me some love and rainbows... sure, I'll do it.": "",
  "They do as much of a dance as they can in their confined space, \"Ssssee, I've alwaysss known you Federattttion guyssss were awessssome! Alwaysss loved them!\" Right... well, regardless of the Slug's flip-flopping glazing, you move in to deal with the Husks aboard their ship. As you make your approach, the Slug's ship shifts slightly, tensing for a moment before making a jittery approach of its own!": "",
  "Sorry, but I'd rather not.": "",
  "It's hard to get a good read on a Slug's expressions, but you're sure there were mixed feelings of terror and hopelessness overcoming them as you ended the call. Unfortunately for them, you can't make EVERYBODY'S problems your own. You've got to look after yourself! Yourself, and your, uh... crew! Yeah! You're just a good captain! Right?": "",
  "Ignore the hail, and the ship.": "",
  "Slugs make you uneasy in sectors NOT full of matter-devouring zombies, and, last time you checked, this IS in fact a sector full of matter-devouring zombies. There's definitely something afoot, and you're not falling for it!": "",
  "The fact that the ship's distress beacon had still been on unsettles you. Were you just slightly too late to save them? Had the Husks turned it on as some kind of lure? You'd hope they aren't that smart... you may never know the truth, though.": "",
  "It doesn't take you very long to pinpoint the call's exact location: a Lanius ship amongst the clouds. They hail as you come near, \"See help beam? Here help? Ate fuel, no move. Need help move.\" Indeed, their engines are offline... there's no telling how long they've been stranded here.": "",
  "Give the Lanius some of your fuel.": "",
  "You send a few fuel rods over, and the Lanius' expression fails to shift. Still, you figure they're appreciative as they continue, \"Many danger here. Bad metal, seen many. Bad metal make into bad man. Know places, help know places. Help avoid bad man.\" You're confused for a moment, but then your navigational systems receive a new file... the Lanius have sent over a mapped chart of the sector as thanks!": "",
  "Thank them for their help, and be on your way.": "",
  "\"Thanking you. Move soon, thanks you.\" You leave the Lanius to their own devices, and prepare to jump to the next beacon yourself.": "",
  "Ask them what they were doing here in the first place.": "",
  "\"Thinking abandoned, looking metal. Find bad metal. Bad metal hurt. Like looking metal elsewhere now, fuel help.\" You'd like to look for scrap elsewhere yourself, quite frankly...": "",
  "Interesting. Thank them for their help, and be on your way.": "",
  "Take advantage of their helplessness and attack.": "",
  "The Lanius aren't capable of putting up much of a fight in their current state, and you're easily able to force them to surrender. They begrudgingly hand over whatever they can at your demand, and your coffers are slightly fuller for it. It's a good thing that the truth of this ill deed is something they'll take to their graves, out here in the middle of nowhere...": "",
  "Apologize, but insist that you can't help.": "",
  "Their expression fails to shift, but you figure they're disappointed as they speak, \"Is alright. Maybe other help. Help beam on. Thanking anyways.\" Regrettably, you leave the Lanius to their own devices, and prepare to jump to the next beacon.": "",
  "It doesn't take you very long to pinpoint the call's exact location: a Separatist ship amongst the clouds. They hail as you come near, \"Federation: -here?- We: must [ask] that you keep our presence here -secret.- Are: you here to -help?- Our: hull has been -shattered.- We: can [repair] it, but we've [run] out of parts with which to [construct] our [repair] -drones.-\" Indeed, their hull is quite damaged... there's no telling how many fights they've endured here.": "",
  "Give the Separatists some of your drone parts.": "",
  "You send a few drone parts over, and the Separatist does a curt bow in thanks. You get the feeling that they're not used to doing so, but appreciate the gesture nevertheless as they continue, \"We: [thank] -you.- There: is much that we have [seen] -here.- Allow: us to [share] it with -you.-\" You're confused for a moment, but then your navigational systems receive a new file... the Separatists have sent over a mapped chart of the sector as thanks!": "",
  "\"You: are too kind to be [thanking] -us.- Good: luck, with whatever you're [doing] out -here.-\" You leave the Separatists to their own devices, and prepare to jump to the next beacon.": "",
  "They seem hesitant to answer, as they stare blankly for a moment before finally speaking, \"There: was something we [wished] to [find] out: -here.- A: boon with which to [fell] the -Harmony.- Unfortunately: this abundance of Soulplague Husks were not within our -calculations.- We: [believe] it is time to -leave.-\" You'd like to leave yourself, quite frankly...": "",

  "It doesn't take you very long to pinpoint the call's exact location: a pirate ship amongst the clouds. They hail as you come near, \"A Renegade? What the hell are you doing out here in THIS shithole? Nevermind that; we just had a run-in with some freaky... THINGS, and the bastards got away with the captain. I've a mind to blow them back to whatever hell-pit they crawled out of, but we ran out of missiles in the fight... give a bloke a hand?\" Indeed, their weapons are uncharged... there's no telling how honest they're being with their intentions, though.": "",
  "Give the pirates some of your missiles.": "",
  "You send a few missiles over, and the pirate speaking rubs their hands together, \"Now we're talking! Hey, we'll keep this on the down-low. Know it ain't a good look helping blokes like us, even if it's out of the kindness of your damn heart, or whatever.\" They scratch their chin for a moment, seemingly deep in thought, before continuing, \"You know, the captain would disagree with this, but he's not here, is he? And I'm not one to leave debts unpaid.\" You're confused for a moment, but then your navigational systems receive a new file... the pirates have sent over a mapped chart of the sector as thanks!": "",
  "\"Thank you, you glorious bastard! It's about time we give those rainbow weirdos a piece of our mind.\" You leave the pirates to their own devices, and prepare to jump to the next beacon.": "",
  "\"At first, the captain was certain the Shells left something valuable out here, and it sounded like a fun enough jig. That was before his ass was dragged out of the airlock, screaming. Still, though, we got a good look over the place before it happened, and if there's any bloody secret treasure it's damn well hidden.\" The possibility of hidden treasure is indeed alluring...": "",

We may be bastards, but we're damn crafty bastards!\" At least they're in high spirits. Regrettably, you leave the pirates to their own devices, and prepare to jump to the next beacon.": "",
  "It doesn't take you very long to pinpoint the call's exact location: a ship amongst the clouds. Something about its movements strikes you as being odd, though, before it suddenly hits you... this ship's been overrun by Husks! Aware of your presence now, they prepare to overrun your ship next!": "",
  "According to your map, there's a distress call here, but your systems read that its source is still a bit deeper within the nebula. You'll have to go out of your way to find it.": "",
  "Search for the signal's source.": "",
  "Pay the signal no mind.": "",
  "You've got your own priorities, and little interest in trying to find a needle in a haystack. Content with your decision, you're left with naught but the stormy clouds around you as you wait for the FTL to charge.": "",
  "The assortment of loot present is odd, almost random, but you're satisfied with everything of value you're able to grab. With the wreckage picked clean, there's little else to do but leave the beacon.": "",
  "You quickly find that there's little here of actual value; mostly just some burnt scrap. With it onboard, though, you begin to get a closer look at it... is it burnt, or, uh... oily?": "",
  "Wait a minute!": "",
  "This isn't any ordinary scrap... some of it's been infected by that damn mattervirus! Before you can act on this realization, the tainted scrap bubbles, and oozes, as several Soulplague Husks come to life!": "",
  "It's not a pleasant sight that greets you here, as you're eager to answer the distress call... whatever ship that had been sending it has been completely disfigured beyond repair. It's little more than a loose pile of scrap now, floating amongst the clouds.": "",
  "Damn...": "",
  "You're able to spot the distress beacon within the wreckage, and end its signal for good. It's a shame you were too late, but you hope that the souls who fell here can at least rest peacefully. Another part of you senses an opportunity, however...": "",
  "An opportunity, indeed! Loot that wreckage!": "",
  "Let us be respectful. Disturb the remains no further.": "",
  "People died here, and you're not about to forsake what little remains as proof of their existence. With a heavy heart, you turn away from the wreckage and find a quiet spot to brood while the FTL charges.": "",
  "Was this some kind of ambush by the Husks? You shiver at the possibility... still, there's little left to do but move on. At the very least, that's one less ship full of mindless zombies left to harass the galaxy.": "",
  "Within a clearing in the nebula, it doesn't take you very long to spot the ship emitting the distress call... unfortunately, nor does it take you very long to realize that it's being piloted by Husks! They're headed this way!": "",
  "You'd hope the less nebulous regions of the sector to be a little safer, but the ship jittering back and forth here seems intent on crushing that hope... Husks, incoming!": "",
  "You're realizing that you can't trust a single thing in this sector, regardless of whether or not you're inside the actual nebula. With as many Husks as there are out here, you wonder how far they've managed to spread...": "",
  "There's a Shell ship resting here, but they don't pay any mind to your arrival. Odd that they're here, but you suppose being just about anywhere but inside the nebula is preferable.": "",
  "Maybe we should get their attention? Hail the Shells.": "",
  "You send a request to hail, and their ship shifts slightly, before stumbling back and forth almost drunkenly... these aren't Shells at all! Their loose movements tighten somewhat, honed in on your position, and you realize you've disturbed a nest of Husks!": "",
  "Oh, they can ignore me, but I'm not going to ignore them. Attack the Shells!": "",
  "You approach the Shells, weapons charging, and their ship shifts slightly, before stumbling back and forth almost drunkenly... these aren't Shells at all! Their loose movements tighten somewhat, honed in on your position, and you realize you've disturbed a nest of Husks!": "",
  "They can keep to themselves. Ignore the Shells.": "",
  "Quite frankly, you're not very interested in why they're here. What you ARE interested in is getting out of here, and waiting around and charging the FTL furthers that goal.": "",
  "Peace within a sector as turbulent as this one is rare indeed, and yet you've managed to find a quiet, empty spot away from all the chaos. You'll have to make sure to enjoy it while it lasts...": "",
  "As the final chain comes undone, the box begins to rumble... its side bursts open, and from it, a smell most rancid fills the air. You take a step back as a black mass oozes its way out from the opening, and Husks begin to coalesce in front of you! Just once, you'd like to get lucky and find some loot...": "",
  "The final chain comes undone, and you open the box... from it, a smell most rancid fills the air. You take a step back as your eyes adjust to the darkness inside, and you realize you're face to face with a Husk!

You'd think it's dead if you hadn't seen the way Husks melt into deactivated matter puddles on the floor...": "",
  "There's no time to hesitate. Shoot the damn thing!": "",
  "You shake your head, breaking your hesitation, and open fire on the Husk. It comes to life as you do so, and you make a run for it!": "",
  "Wave at the Husk.": "",
  "You wave at it, and, to your disgust, it waves back. As you take another step back, it takes a step toward you, and you realize it's vaguely mocking your movements... useful, if not, uh... uncomfortable. Welcome to the crew, Husk thing...?": "",
  "Mirrorman": "",
  "The final chain comes undone, and you open the box... from it, a smell most rancid fills the air. You take a step back as your eyes adjust to the darkness inside, and you see... a weapon. Not just any weapon, though, but one entirely infected by the Soulplague mattervirus! A nice find, even if you'll have to mount it with a bit of care.": "",
  "Floating within the space outside is a metallic box, tightly chained shut at every end, but otherwise featureless. Attempts to discern its contents prove futile, leaving you to question what exactly you're dealing with here...": "",
  "Bring the strange box aboard.": "",
  "Though it doesn't take much effort to get the box inside, it proves much more difficult to actually move it around. Once it's somewhere you're satisfied with, you're able to get a better look at it... rather than being as featureless as you thought, you're able to make out some faded lettering engraved on its side:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"PROPERTY OF THE GENIOCRACY SCIENCE DISTRICT, EPSILON DIVISION\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWell, luckily for you, you don't see any Shells around to take issue with your pillaging. All that's left to do is open the box.": "",
  "Break off the box's chains, and open it.": "",
  "You don't trust the contents of this box one bit; who knows what the hell the Geniocracy's been up to out here? Throwing it back outside, you watch as it slowly floats away into the distance... perhaps someone else will come across it one day.": "",
  "Leave the box alone.": "",
  "You wouldn't trust a random box out here if it was made of rainbows and candy, let alone metal and chains... something about it makes you uneasy. Leaving it well alone, you watch as the box slowly floats away into the distance... perhaps someone else will come across it one day.": "",
  "You can't believe you let the Rebels get the jump on you like that... a lesson to never trust empty beacons, no matter how peaceful they may seem! Especially not in a sector as bleak and dreary as this one...": "",
  "There's a flash of light from outside, as a Rebel Auto-ship comes roaring into the beacon - there's no peace here at all! It sends an automated message as its weapons begin to charge, \"D-d-do not resi-s-st. Your dea- DEATH- eath- d-death will be s-swiiiift.\" When's the last time this thing's had a check-up for its communication to be so garbled? Not that it really matters... get ready!": "",
  "Some peace, and quiet... not something to get used to, but you'll still cherish it nonetheless. It sure as hell beats another encounter with Husks, at the very least.": "",
  "There's a sinking feeling in your stomach as the shadow of a ship looms within the nebula outside. You catch its attention, and your worst fears are confirmed as it makes its unsteady approach!": "",
  "Something unsettles you about Soulplague Husks. You're not sure if it's their very nature as by-products of death, the way innumerable tentacles burst out of their chest when they're being aggressive, or the fact that their multi-colored faces mock the very life from which they sprout... but you have plenty of time to figure it out while they make another assault on your ship!": "",
  "For a moment, there's a glimmer of hope in your heart as you spot a ship outside... but it's extinguished in an instant when you notice the way they move. It's yet another Husk ship, and they're headed this way!": "",
  "You feel as if this sector chokes out all semblances of life, using these damnable Husks as its executioner. It's uncertain whether or not anthropomorphizing a sector like that is a sign that you're losing it a little, but the fact of the matter is that your life could very well be next on the chopping block.": "",
  "Is there an end to these Husks? For what reason do they plague this sector? As another ship overran by them makes its jittery, unsettling approach, you make a silent vow to get to the bottom of these questions... and put an end to their propagation.": "",
  "A ship roars past you as you enter the beacon, but you don't get a good look at it before it sinks deeper into the nebula. Following it comes a second ship, much shakier in its approach... you quickly realize that they're Husks, and it seems you've pulled their attention!": "",
  "There's a sinking feeling in your stomach as the shadow of a ship looms within the storm outside. You catch its attention, and your worst fears are confirmed as it makes its unsteady approach!": "",
  "For a moment, there's a glimmer of hope in your heart as you spot a ship amidst the storm... but it's extinguished in an instant when you notice the way they move. It's yet another Husk ship, and they're headed this way!": "",
  "A ship roars past you as you enter the beacon, but you don't get a good look at it before it sinks deeper into the storm. Following it comes a second ship, much shakier in its approach... you quickly realize that they're Husks, and it seems you've pulled their attention!": "",
  "There's a sinking feeling in your stomach as the shadow of a ship looms within the clearing in the nebula outside. You catch its attention, and your worst fears are confirmed as it makes its unsteady approach!": "",
  "For a moment, there's a glimmer of hope in your heart as you spot a ship amidst the thin nebula... but it's extinguished in an instant when you notice the way they move. It's yet another Husk ship, and they're headed this way!": "",
  "A ship roars past you as you enter the beacon, but you don't get a good look at it before it retreats from the clearing and sinks back into the nebula. Following it comes a second ship, much shakier in its approach... you quickly realize that they're Husks, and it seems you've pulled their attention!": "",
  "Considering its occupants, you make sure to be careful as you scrap the remains of the Husk-infested ship. Would be a shame if you picked up any contaminated scrap, and the cycle started anew...": "",
  "Bits of Soulplague-infected matter go flying in random directions as the Husk ship breaks apart, but you're able to avoid their path and find what resources you can among the wreckage.": "",
  "Good riddance... one less batch of Husks left to plague the galaxy. Hopefully, the ship's previous owners can rest easy now that you've avenged them.": "",
  "That's the end of that. You shiver, considering the possibility that your ship and its crew could very well meet a similar fate at the mattervirus' hands, but there's little to worry about if you can keep these victories against its Husks consistent.": "",
  "Destroying ships overtaken by Husks is bittersweet, but reaping their rewards is evidently less so. Blasting zombies to hell, and collecting fat stacks of scrap and resources... you could get used to this, if this place didn't make you feel so uncomfortable.": "",
  "Soulplague-infected wrecks are only slightly safer to be around than when they're fully functional, but you're confident enough in your abilities to discern between authentic matter and... the more icky bits.": "",
  "The unease in the air is palpable as the halls of the Husk-infested ship are traversed. Best make this quick, before anyone steps in any iridescent puddles of infected matter...": "",
  "While the Husks have been dealt with, you understand that the mattervirus that birthed them is not to be underestimated as you carefully gather what loot you can from the ship's remains.": "",
  "As you wander the inside of the freshly emptied ship, you can't help but feel for its previous occupants... the, uh, NOT horribly oily and tentacled ones.": "",
  "Husks may be formidable, but you've proven yourself moreso here today. With them now being little more than puddles on the floor, you're free to scavenge the inside of the ship they'd hijacked.": "",
  "An onslaught... but not one you can't overcome. Having braved these undead horrors, the spoils of war are now yours for the taking. Just make sure to leave any rainbow bits behind, yeah?": "",
  "Cleaning up the mess these Husks make isn't pleasant, but at least the pools of deactivated matter they leave behind are mostly harmless once the effects of their death knell fade away. Still, what's less harmless is the very-much-still activated matter aboard their ship... it takes a careful eye to discern between what's valuable and what's life-threatening.": "",
  "Even out here, you aren't safe from the Rebellion's influence... still, you'll take blowing up Auto-ships over Husks any day. They're much less messy, and much more... crunchy.": "",
  "As one of their Auto-ships approach, the possibility of the Rebels weaponizing the Soulplague mattervirus for their own ill intentions flashes into your mind. You have to hope that the Corruptor system remains under-utilized by the galaxy at large...": "",
  "There's a Slug ship in the nebula here, and, judging by its smooth movements, it hasn't been overrun by Husks! That's where the good news ends, unfortunately, as they point their weapons at you and demand your valuables... some things never change.": "",
  "Though you don't spot any ships, you're hailed as you enter the beacon. Tentatively, you answer, and a Slug vaguely illuminated by naught but the light of their screen appears on the other end, \"I don't care HOW many Fedssss the Clairvoyantsss ssssend, I am NOT paying my taxessss!\" They end the call before you can get a word in, and their ship appears from the clouds outside with its weapons charging. Why would the Clairvoyants even send Federation vessels to collect taxes, and why does it not surprise you that a Slug would sooner hide in a zombie-infested sector than pay them?": "",
  "It's difficult to tell between genuine wrecks and Ghost-occupied ones as is, let alone when you've got Husks around hijacking ships of their own. The only signifier is the fact that the ruined vessel's approaching steadily, with its weapons charging!": "",
  "Normally, you'd be ecstatic to identify a vessel not infested with Husks in this hell, but the Ghosts here don't seem to take too kindly to your presence. You're not sure if they think you're Husks yourselves, or if they just don't like you, but it seems that they're intent on attacking regardless!": "",
  "There's a piercing, yet heavenly, cry that rings in your head as the Seraphim Prophet crumbles, and explodes... you've survived!": "",
  "There's a piercing, yet heavenly, cry that rings in your head as the final Seraph falls, and their ship crumbles, and explodes... you've survived!": "",
  "The old man brings himself to his feet, dusting off his armor, \"If that'll be all, then, I do believe it would be best that we got on our way. Though we have our differences, you HAVE helped me here today, even if this predicament was your fault in the first place... I believe it to be best that I travel with you for some time. At least, until the Tempest orders me otherwise.\" He begins to walk away, when you realize that you do have a question in mind still...": "",
  "Wait, what's your name?": "",
  "He turns back to you, a smirk on his face, \"The Tempest took my true name when I donned this armor, but... you may call me the Minister, as my underlings do. Or the Tempest's Hand; either will suffice.\" You get the feeling that he gets a kick from these titles... either way, it seems that it's time you set off. There's no telling what similar madness awaits you deeper within the nebula, but there's a warmth in your heart as you prepare to leave; a comfort born from the fact that you won't have to face these horrors alone.": "",
  "The Minister": "",
  "As you prepare to set off, though... something amidst the nebula's clouds catches your attention. You quickly realize what it is - a gap in the seams that bind the Multiverse. This is what the Seraphim must've come here to protect...": "",
  "You don't get a verbal answer - rather, you receive a very, very physical one... as a shockwave roars out from the seams' gap, and you find your ship being pulled in at impossible speeds! There's no escaping this - you need to grab onto something, and fast!": "",
  "You've no intention of breaching this thing, with no expertise of your own - who knows what hellish reality you'd end up in! More than satisfied in leaving the seams' gap alone, you find yourself preparing to head out once more.": "",
  "Following it, you indeed come across the old man... but not his ship. It's unclear what went wrong, and how, but his body is simply floating here in space... unmoving. His vital signatures read back negative.": "",
  "Retrieve the old man's corpse.": "",
  "With a heavy heart, you give the order to bring his body inside. Getting a closer look at him, it seems his face has been severely burned, to the point that you wouldn't recognize him were it not for the odd armor he's wearing. You're considering possible options for resuscitation when your hand grazes a white orb embedded in the middle of the armor's chest, and you're sent back reeling as electricity begins to arc around it!": "",
  "Watch in awe.": "",
  "You get a bit of distance and watch as the electricity grows in strength, eventually forming something akin to a cocoon around the old man's body. With a thunderous roar, it dissipates, and the man shoots up with a gasp, \"Oh! Oh, by the Tempest above, thank all that is sacred that you received my missive. I was fearful that...\" He pauses as he gets a good look at you, and the relief on his face dissolves away into a grimace much more sour, \"...that some hooligan would come across me first. So, you did survive... and, somehow, you've gotten to me before any of my underlings. Wondrous.\"": "",
  "Is that any way to thank me? I just saved your life!": "",
  "The old man wipes away at his face with one of his gauntlets, and you realize his face has been miraculously cured of its burns, \"YOU haven't saved a damn thing! Other than yourself, perhaps. I'd told you my survival was all but guaranteed, and I meant it. It doesn't matter whether you, an underling, or one of this horrid sector's abominable Husks found me; I am to be revived as soon I'm within an environment considered suitable for habitation. Thus is the Tempest's will.\"": "",
  "The Tempest?": "",
  "He drops back to his knees, exhausted and annoyed in equal measure, \"My patron, of sorts, if it means anything to you. We don't exactly see eye to eye, but it ensures that my work may continue in exchange for these - these DAMN tasks! It HAD to be the Seraphim! This armor may render me nigh immortal, but it makes being immolated no more pleasant! The bastards got my ship, as well, by the look of things...\" The man puts a hand to his temple once more, and you get the feeling that he does that a lot...": "",
  "Your patron? Your work? Tasks? Seraphim? I have a lot of questions...": "",
  "There's a moment as he groans, and clenches his free hand, before he relents with a defeated tone, \"I do suppose I'm stuck here for the time being. It would seem that this chance encounter is more fated that I'd presumed... I suspect that the Tempest wants me here, regardless of my own desires. Very well; I will answer your questions, belligerent one. Ask away...\"": "",
  "You mentioned that this Tempest is your patron. What does that entail, exactly? Who are they?": "",
  "\"It is less of a 'who' and more of a 'what'. The Tempest, as I've come to know it, is a construct most grand, located in a realm well beyond the seams that bind our reality. Something of a... pocket dimension. Many years ago, I'd sacrificed everything to reach this so-called promised land and have an audience with the thing... it was said to grant miracles. To fulfill one's grandest desires. Yet, I feel that it's done little but toy with me!\" The man pauses for a moment, gesturing to his armor, \"It took what felt like forever just to get it to acknowledge me, and when it finally did, it branded me in this DAMNABLE armor! It's been decades since I was forced to don it, and not once within that time have I been free from its confines.\"": "",
  "What is it exactly?": "",
  "He sighs, \"Hell if I know. The Tempest uses it to control me, in its own way... sending me on these frivolous death sentences. That's not to say it's without its perks, though; the armor doesn't allow me to die, and among the Tempest's blessings are powers most useful. Immortality may be seen as a curse to some, but... I've a mission, here in life, that I simply cannot allow myself to fail. The armor ensures that, in its own way.\"": "",
  "That's a lot to absorb... let's take a step back for a moment. The Shells we fought also mentioned these seams; what are they?": "",
  "You mention the strange Shells you encountered, and the man's grimace deepens, \"The Seraphim... yes, they care to see to it that these seams are not breached, and that interdimensional travelers looking to enter their lane, so to speak, fail to do so.\" He looks you over, judgmentally, \"I... don't suppose you're familiar with Universal Cluster Theory?\"": "",
  "I, uh, can't say I am.": "",
  "\"I can hardly blame you; merely suggesting that there may be some truth to it was almost enough to get me kicked from the force back in my time as an engineer for the Rebellion.\" He notices as you tense up at that, and rolls his eyes, \"That was many years ago as well, Renegade. I've no love for them now. Not after...\" The man drifts off for a moment, before shaking his head, \"...anyways. Universal Cluster Theory is hardly scientific, to say the least, and its supporting evidence is shoddy at best, but it suggests that realities within our Multiverse are segmented via similar defining aspects; consider that nobody has ever seen a dimension composed entirely of chocolate pudding, for example. The theory suggests that this can be explained by the fact that no reality akin to ours could possibly ever be composed entirely of chocolate pudding, and that we may merely find realities more in-line with our own 'cluster'; say, one where Slugs love to eat chocolate pudding for no reason apparent to us.\"": "",
  "Right... and where do the Seraphim come into this?": "",
  "He scratches his chin, \"If a dimension composed entirely of chocolate pudding sounds unfeasible, consider one composed ALMOST entirely of fire and brimstone. This is from where the Seraphim hail; a hell entirely alien to us, but the place they call home nonetheless. I've... been there, during a time where the Seraphim were less aggressive towards outsiders. Their reality remains the closest to the pocket dimension from which the Tempest sits, and so it acts as something of a direct gateway to it. The problem with this... are the Multiverse's seams. Regardless of whether or not one subscribes to Universal Cluster Theory, I have gathered enough evidence firsthand to prove that some realities are undoubtedly much more difficult to travel into than ones we'd consider familiar; crossing into the Seraphim's reality, for example, requires locating and precisely exploiting a gap in spacetime. The Seraphim called these gaps 'breaches in the seams', and I merely adopted the term after my brief incursion through their reality.\"": "",
  "Damn, alright... that's a lot to take in. You mentioned that the Seraphim used to be less aggressive. Did something happen?": "",
  "\"I'm not privy to the details myself. From what little interaction I've had with them since, it seems they've turned to hating the Tempest and any who would seek to interact with it. Perhaps the nature of its location, and the fact that people must travel through their reality to reach it? It's hard for me to say, but the fact of the matter is that they defend these breaches in the seams with their lives, as you've seen here today.\"": "",
  "Speaking of... is that why you came out here, then? To breach the seams and enter the Seraphim's reality again?": "",
  "He shakes his head at that, \"Oh, by the Tempest, no. I've little interest in ever witnessing that hell again. The Tempest demanded it, and I do as the Tempest demands. It's as simple as that, and I can't question it, even if I wanted to. The most I can do is theorize that it wants this breach left open for someone, or something, and has used me to ensure that that's the case.\"": "",
  "If the breach is open, then... could we enter it?": "",
  "The old man laughs, \"Not unless you've a death wish! Even if you did have one, though, the breach has only merely been binded. It still requires precise exploitation to reach the exact dimension you want; lest you mistakenly drown in chocolate pudding.\" You give him a certain look, and his face darkens, \"No, I am not performing any such 'precise exploitation' for the sake of your curiosity. You may find someone else knowledgable on the matter if you wish to die, but I'd struggle to believe anybody else in-the-know would be suicidal enough to agree to it. I only did it, so long ago, because I felt I had no other choice...\"": "",
  "Right... you keep alluding to that. What drove you to travel through hell and seek the Tempest's audience, then?": "",
  "\"I'd... briefly mentioned my involvement with the Rebellion earlier. To elaborate, I worked amongst Vance's team of Head Engineers; I was tasked with perfecting the Multiverse Drive and securing an advantage over the competition. We were to breach realities others couldn't dream of finding, and guarantee a Rebel victory the easy way. It was during my research on this project that I stumbled upon Universal Cluster Theory, as well as... darker findings.\"": "",
  "Darker findings? Such as?": "",
  "He shivers, \"Evidence of dimensions much more frightening than our own; evidence suggesting that we were making a terrible mistake in trying to escape the familiarity of dimensions akin to Universe 0. Even at the time, I was disturbed, but cancelling the project wasn't my call to make... to this day, I still don't know where exactly the orders came from. Some simpleton higher up, too high on the promise of glory to consider the consequences. The consequences that I would be the one to pay! The consequences that... my daughter would pay.\"": "",
  "Your daughter...": "",
  "\"Yes, my darling Evelyn...\" For a moment, he sounds close to tears, but you get the feeling, as he stares off into space, that he's lamented over the matter for so long that he struggles to bring himself to shed anymore tears for her. After a moment, he continues, \"It was an ordinary day at the lab; we were testing one of the prototype Multiverse Drives. She'd insisted that she come along and watch, and I... was a terrible father. I couldn't bring myself to tell her no, and it...\" There's another pause, as he looks to the floor, \"...something went wrong with the experiment, and the Drive begun to tear the place apart. The last I saw of Evelyn before it pulled her through an interdimensional vortex was the smile she gave me, like nothing could harm her as long as I was around...\" His stature sinks, even deeper, before he continues again, \"...I was devastated. We managed to shut the Drive off before much more was lost, but it was already too late at that point. I'd felt like I'd lost everything.\"": "",
  "I see. I'm sorry...": "",
  "The old man looks up at you, \"Don't be. I only have myself to blame... and blame myself I did. Though I would continue working for the Rebellion for some time, it was mostly a front to further my own goals at that point. My goal of finding her... of bringing Evelyn back...\" He begins to stare off at nothing again, \"...I'd come to meet a man. One robed in golden silks finer than any I'd ever dreamed of seeing. I shared with him my plight; I couldn't even say why, really, but I felt that I could trust him. He would nod, and listen along as I lamented. Eventually, this would become a habit, and we'd meet up for this pseudo-therapy more often... until, one day, he offered me a solution. He told me of the Tempest; of how it granted wishes. Of the seams between reality, and how to reach it from them. It all sounded so insane, but I was so... desperate. I stole away with one of the Multiverse Drives, and did as the man had instructed. That's the last I ever saw of him, or the Rebellion... I've been the Tempest's Hand ever since that journey concluded.\"": "",
  "So, you work for the Tempest, but... what of your wish?": "",
  "\"I'm not sure. So much time has passed, and never once has the Tempest spoken a word to me. The only choice I'm left with is to do as it wills me, through this armor... to run its Cult, perform its rituals and spread its blessings. I've no clue to what end.\" He looks at you, a sadness in his eyes, \"I can only pray that at the end of this journey, the Tempest grants my wish, and I can see her again.\"": "",
  "I have no further questions.": "",
  "Actually, honestly, I'll pass on the questions.": "",
  "You breathe a heavy sigh of relief, and await a call back from that strange old man. Stranger than him, though... is the fact that that call never comes. He hasn't left without a word, has he? You still haven't gotten your loot! Maybe you can find his ship amidst the nebula, somehow...?": "",
  "(Stormborn Spawn) Look to the monstrous blob you were given for answers.": "",
  "Though you can't tell what compelled you to do so, you approach the grotesque thing and get REAL close. You can hear as each and every one of its fibers squirm, as its maws snap, as its eyes blink... and you stare into those many, blinking eyes. You feel... a connection there. Not to you, but to somewhere nearby. You can't explain it, but you feel as if you understand the old man's exact location just through this thing's connection to him...": "",
  "Follow this strange feeling.": "",
  "(Slug Crew) Have your Slug try to locate him.": "",
  "Your Slug looks over the vast space outside, and is able to get a faint reading some distance away... emphasis on faint. Has something gone wrong?": "",
  "Follow your Slug's reading.": "",
  "(Telepathic Shell) Have your Shell try to locate him.": "",
  "Your Shell looks over the vast space outside, and is able to get a faint reading some distance away... emphasis on faint. Has something gone wrong?": "",

  "Follow your sensors' reading.": "",
  "Try to find him yourself.": "",
  "You know it to be a fool's errand, but you can't help but try regardless... unfortunately, manually combing something as vast as a nebula for a single ship is an excercise in futility. You don't find a single trace of the old man after a few minutes of searching, and your gut tells you no amount of additional minutes is going to change that. It's time to leave, empty-handed...": "",
  "The strange Crystal transport's coordinates pointed to this location.": "",
  "You've arrived at the mysterious coordinates, though... if there's anything here, you can't make it out amongst the nebula. The space here feels as dead as the rest of the sector.": "",
  "There's got to be something here!": "",
  "As if to prove your proclamation right, you receive a hail from an unknown location as you throw your tantrum. Eager to get the loot you've earned, you accept it, and are met with the backside of an elderly man clad in black armor as he tinkers with something out of view, \"Vydoorin, you're late; again! Were you expecting me to deal with this matter myself? The hour is nearly upon us, and we're left with little time to prepare the rites thanks to you and your sect's tardiness. Tell me, have you at least brought the binding regent?\" You're unsure of how to respond, and the man repeats himself after a moment, \"Well? You have, haven't you?\"": "",
  "You stammer over your words, and the man turns around, \"Are you TRYING to-\" He pauses mid-sentence as he sees you, blinks a few times, and then puts a finger to his temple as a look of annoyance washes over his face, \"You are not Vydoorin. Tell me; how did you find me here, in the middle of nowhere?\"": "",
  "Well, I...": "",
  "He cuts you off, as you stumble over your words, \"Oh, it hardly matters. We're almost out of time... looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way.\" The man moves his head to the side a little, as if it would help him see over your shoulder, before shaking his head and sighing, \"Your vessel will have to do. It seems capable enough, if little else.\"": "",
  "What? What are you talking about?": "",
  "\"So you CAN speak! Enlightening. Listen here, intruder, and listen well. I can only imagine what you've done to Vydoorin's sect to find your way here, but I am left with little option but to put that aside for the sake of what's to come.\" He motions towards a window with his spare hand, the other still to his temple, \"There is only one way we may both survive this- well, there is only one way YOU may survive this. My survival is all but guaranteed, but that's beside the point. You must handle the brunt of their force while I perform the binding... regentless, thanks to your meddling, but it should remain feasible as long as you simply DON'T die. Can you manage that?\"": "",
  "Hold on. THEIR force? You're still speaking vaguely...": "",
  "The man slams his armored fist against the console, \"The Seraphim, dammit! They're almost-\" He's interrupted as a flash of light from outside overtakes the both of you, its sheer brilliance piercing even the nebula around you, and you're left dazed...": "",
  "Gather your wits.": "",
  "As you come to, and the blinding light fades, you realize in its place sits a Shell ship wreathed in truly radiant flames. The man's annoyed demeanor drops as he sees this ship himself, and continues speaking, in a low whisper, \"They're here. Remember: do NOT die. I will send what little assistance I can afford to spare when a fight inevitably breaks out. And don't even try to think about running; I've ensured you can't. Consider it Vydoorin's final regards.\" Indeed, you check, and it looks like your FTL drive has been overloaded with energy somehow, crippling it for the time being... it seems you'll have to do as the old man asks.": "",
  "Take a deep breath, and face the flaming ship.": "",
  "The man ends the call, as the Shells hail you themselves, and you realize that they aren't just any Shells... massive, blazing wings sprout forth from their backs, curling around them to form what almost resembles a secondary shell. One of them speaks as you're lost in their collective magnificence, \"So it is a Renegade, of thhhe Federation, thhhhat would seek to exploit thhhis fault in thhhhe seams... thhhhus is it our duty to punish thhhis insolence, and ensure thhhhat thhhis fault is closed. Burn before thhhhe light, and repent; so thhhhat thhhe taint withhhin you may be purged, and we may know peace once more!\" You imagine that that'll be a stern 'no' in regards to negotiation, then... what exactly have you gotten yourself into, though? Seams? Taint? Burning? You don't like the sound of that last one in particular...": "",
  "There's another flash of light as a bolt of lightning strikes your ship, and you're blinded once more. You blink a few times to regain your vision, and before you is one of the strange, tentacled abominations you'd felled earlier! Though, it doesn't seem to be as aggressive... is this that old man's idea of assistance?! It'll have to do, as the flaming Shell ship approaches; prepare yourself!": "",
  "Mist'tsk": "",
  "The Ultima Armor seems to almost look at you.": "",
  "Even if there's something here, you get the uneasy feeling that the Ultima Armor doesn't want you to find it... it looks like you'll have to leave, with nothing but disappointment to show for it.": "",
  "The Geniocracy Radiant District is typically tasked with protecting Shell space, but, for some reason, one of their vessels is present in the nebula here. You're considering asking them why when they turn to face you, weapons charging! They must consider you a threat!": "",
  "You noticed this location, and its corrupted data, as you entered the sector.": "",
  "The strange, marked beacon appears to have led you to a clearing in the nebula, but... is there nothing else here?": "",
  "I don't see anything.": "",
  "You remark at the beacon's emptiness to yourself, and a rogue thought enters your head:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFor you haven't the eyes to see.": "",
  "The eyes to see... what does that mean?": "",
  "An explosion from behind you sends you flying into the ship's console, and you turn around to see... someone armored head-to-toe, stepping out of some kind of portal. No, not so much stepping out as much as they're fighting their way out - the spear in their hands tearing away at the goopy, oily tentacles that threaten to pull them in. You realize that you recognize these tentacles... this is Soulplague-infected matter! You watch, in awe, as the figure finishes cutting away at the tentacles, and the portal shuts closed behind them. They take a moment to wipe themself off, deactivated Soulplague matter splattering against the floor as they do so, before turning to you, pointing at themself, and finally speaking:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"It means... you're gonna need a little help!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYou figure that sounded cooler in their head, and you're still not really sure what that means, but at the very least you're able to remark on their voice. Though they're muffled behind their helmet, you feel that they sound feminine, theatrical and exhausted. Especially exhausted.": "",
  "Alright, uh... ma'am? Who are you? And do you often break into people's ships via portal...?": "",
  "\"Break into - you're here because you got my message, RIGHT? You got it, didn't you?\" She didn't object to being called ma'am, so that's that settled. As far as her message goes...": "",
  "Do you mean that weird series of rhymes?": "",
  "She puts her gauntlets together, spear still in hand, awkwardly, \"YES! You've answered the hero's call! Good, because there's not a lot of time to waste; the Children... or, uh, maybe the Weavers now that I think about it... not important! Point being, they're going to come and drag me back any minute now. You, uh...\" She pauses as she gets a good look at you, and her energy tones down a bit, \"...you're not one of us. It's no wonder you can't see it. That's okay, though; you've still answered the call! You've got a hero's heart, and that's all that matters! Though, it does make this rather awkward... do you have any idea what's happening?\"": "",
  "Not a clue.": "",
  "\"I see... well, you're my only chance now, lest I wait another lifetime! I'll have to make this as quick as I can.\" She gathers her thoughts for a moment, and then puts an armored hand to her heart, \"Long ago... no, that's stupid. Listen. Something's out to keep me trapped; something ancient, malevolent and calculating. It would trick a collective of Shells to do so, and damn the entire Multiverse while it's at it; you have to have seen the echoes of its work if you've come this close to their center, right?\" She gestures outside, and stares inquisitively.": "",
  "Do you mean the Soulplague mattervirus?": "",
  "The armored woman nods, \"It doesn't matter what you want to call it; what it is, is entropy incarnate. It's less of a 'matter' virus, though that name's still apt, and more of a 'spacetime' virus - as far as I can tell, it's been bastardized for the sole purpose of my eternal torment. The Shells who unknowingly created it were wanting the perfect mimic; something that could mirror the characteristics of anything, or anyone, for the purpose of labor. They would come close to achieving this, but ultimately fall short at the finish line... it would be the resulting desperation that compelled them to make a deal they couldn't possibly comprehend the consequences of. This mimic of theirs would be twisted, by dark forces, into what you now call the Soulplague mattervirus: an engine with which to corrupt matter, and use it to create an extradimensional prison. One that bends the laws of space, and time, in order to accomplish one goal: keeping ME trapped forever.\"": "",
  "Well... you don't look particularly trapped. Or extradimensional, for that matter.": "",
  "She throws her hands in the air, \"HEY! Don't you be getting sarcastic with ME! It's not easy fending off endless waves of mindless, tentacled freaks for... one, two... four... ugh, I don't know, centuries? Wow, yeah... you're really the first person I've talked to since this whole thing's started.\"": "",
  "Wait, centuries?! Like, literally?": "",
  "\"YES, literally! Well... also no, not literally. Like I said, this extradimensional prison doesn't function by the same rules as the rest of the Multiverse - it's quite genuinely an extra dimension. It's layered on top of everything, such as time, and space, but also ignorant of it all... for the most part. It's not perfect; part of it still bleeds back through, and that's how you get the supposed results of this 'mattervirus'. This bleeding is misleading, though; the majority of the junk it eats is sent back my way... you'd be seeing waves, in comparison to the oceans I'm forced to drown in.\" She holds one hand at her waist, and the other way up high, as if that's necessary to illustrate her point.": "",
  "Alright, and you... what? Broke out of these oceans?": "",
  "She resets her hands, and shakes her head, \"Oh, how I wish I could. I'm only here on borrowed time... time I've slowly accrued over the course of these infinite, ceaseless battles. TIME, WITH WHICH I AM TO END THIS NIGHTMARE ONCE AND FOR ALL!\" She gets loud, out of nowhere, but calms back down when she notices that she's startled you, \"Well, yes, my tormentors should return any second now. That's where you come in - when they take me back, I would ask that you follow suit. Normally, I wouldn't dream of involving anyone else in this, but I fear there's no other way to end this madness; TRUST ME, I've tried, but the longer I wait... the more time its 'bleeding' is given to devour the realities underneath it.\" Indeed, you've seen the state this sector's in... if you don't act, would the mattervirus one day come to overtake other sectors, too? Would its expansion ever end?": "",
  "Well, what am I supposed to do? You sound, uh... pretty capable.": "",
  "Your comment seems to have stroked her ego slightly, \"Well, as capable as I am, there's still only so many of me. The rate at which the metaphorical ocean grows far outpaces the rate at which I can quell it, and it's proven efficient at preventing my approach of its heart. If you could reach it yourself, though, and buy me enough time to break through... I could pierce it, with ONE MIGHTY BLOW, and put an end to its corruption for good!\" The armored woman poses, triumphantly, and you can't help but feel a little embarrassed.": "",
  "You're certain that this heart exists? And that it's the only thing keeping the mattervirus going?": "",
  "She nods, \"You'll see what I mean soon enough, if you haven't already, but it has a way of worming its way into your mind. For better, or for worse, I don't think there's anything its collective hive mind knows that I don't at this point.\" You squint a little at how insane that sounds, but she doesn't seem to notice as she points her spear in the air, \"Now, tell me - are you to be the fellow hero I seek? There is little shame in walking away; as troublesome as it'll be to get another opportunity like this, I loathe asking such a harrowing task of anyone, and I cannot guarantee that you and your comrades here will make it out with their lives.\"": "",
  "This sounds absurd, but... screw it, I'm in.": "",
  "There's a loud, clanging noise as she slams the butt of her spear against the floor, and puts her hand to her chest once more, \"THAT'S THE HEROIC SPIRIT! To fight for no reason, other than because it is what's right... THIS is how heroes are born. If you are to venture with me into the belly of the beast, then you will be needing this!\" She holds her hand out, palm up, and tenses it... for a moment, you're left wondering what's supposed to happen, but then a resplendent, roaring flame bursts out from the very air between her fingertips! She pulls her hand back, and the golden fire stays hovering in the air where she left it, \"This... is 'hope'. The prison's Children, or, heavens forbid, its Weavers, will undoubtedly try to bargain with you once you're within their realm. They may promise power, freedom, peace, WHATEVER; all of it will be lies for the sole purpose of luring you to your death. THAT, is where 'hope' comes in. It is a fraction of my power, and what's caused my imprisonment in the first place... it is to act as your torch in the upcoming darkness. Invoke it, and you may burn away the shadows of doubt, revealing truth... what that truth entails, exactly, is up to you. I only ask that you use it wisely, for its power is finite.\" She gestures for you to take the flame, and you hestitantly cup it in your hands... but it doesn't burn you. Rather, you feel that you find it soothing.": "",
  "Alright, I'll try to be smart about it. When exactly are we expecting your captors to return, then?": "",
  "\"Well... it's taking longer than I'd expected, but-\" Before she can finish her sentence, another portal appears from the ether and opens up behind her! Much larger than the one she'd come in with, a wave of Soulplague-infected mass sprouts forth from it, grabbing her from every angle. As she's dragged back in, you move to help, but she barely manages to scream out at you in-between struggled breaths, \"NO! Let it take me - you must follow suit! You... must reach the heart! Only you can-\" She's interrupted once more as the Soulplague wave completely envelops her, successfully dragging her in, and the portal closes.": "",
  "Wait! How am I meant to follow you?!": "",
  "Though the silence is deafening, you get your answer another way as the space outside seems to shift, and twist...": "",
  "...and, indeed, some sort sort of vast mass appears, in addition to the sporadic spawning of innumerable rainbow wormholes. It looks like this is it... having already made your decision, you move to fly into one of the wormholes. Brace yourself; you're entering lightspeed!": "",
  "I'll have to pass, sorry.": "",
  "The energy in her movements fades, ever so slightly, as she nods her head once more, \"Then... pay me no mind. It's my fault for assuming you were a hero in the first place... but, fret not! One day, I'll find the help I need. Until then...\" Another portal appears behind her as she speaks, and she walks towards it willingly, \"...I wish you luck with your own struggles.\" The portal engulfs her, and promptly closes, leaving you in silence. A part of you feels guilty, but... you've your own struggles indeed. You'll have to press on.": "",
  "I do; no need to explain.": "",
  "She nods, \"Then, tell me - are you to be the fellow hero I seek? There is little shame in walking away; as troublesome as it'll be to get another opportunity like this, I loathe asking such a harrowing task of anyone, and I cannot guarantee that you and your comrades here will make it out with their lives.\"": "",
  "Of course! I'm in.": "",
  "On the vidscreen appears several Federation and Engi officers, as well as Admiral Tully in the center. He looks a little puzzled for a moment but eventually speaks; \"A Deep One ship? I'd figure that you'd prefer to remain neutral in this affair. Leaving deep space to save the Federation is... heroic, to say the least. I'd thank you, but I have more to ask of you still.\"": "",
  "On the vidscreen appears several Federation and Engi officers, as well as Admiral Tully in the center. The Engi recoil, but Tully assures them before speaking, \"A Disparity ship... wanted by the Harmony you may be, we need all the help we can get right now. Save us, and know that a friend of the Federation may be a friend of the Harmony yet.\"": "",
  "On the vidscreen appears several Federation and Engi officers, as well as Admiral Tully in the center. Tully scratches his head, \"A... flaming ship? I can't say I'm familiar with such a design...\" He turns to his fellow officers, but they too shake their heads, \"Hmm... well, no matter. You're here to help, and we need all the help we can get right now.\"": "",
  "On the vidscreen appears several Federation and Engi officers, as well as Admiral Tully in the center. He gazes at the oddity that is your ship, eyeing it up and down before eventually speaking, \"You're... something strange, aren't you?\" Tully sighs, and stares off at nothing, \"We really are desperate... alright, welcome aboard.\"": "",
  "On the vidscreen appears several Federation and Engi officers, as well as Admiral Tully in the center. There's a concerned look on his face as he speaks, \"I've heard tell from the droppoint that there's been some... complications, as a result of your ship? You seem fine enough yourself, though... I can only hope you know what you're doing. We need you in the fights ahead.\"": "",
  "On the vidscreen appears several Federation and Engi officers, as well as Admiral Tully in the center. He opens his mouth to speak, but then hesitates slightly as he gets a good look at your ship. After a few moments of eyeing it over and exchanging bewildered looks with his fellow officers, he shrugs, and returns his attention towards the vidscreen, \"Those... ARE eyes, aren't they? Oh, forget it - it doesn't matter. We're more than grateful for your assistance, regardless of how odd your taste in ships may be.\"": "",
  "On the vidscreen appears several Federation and Engi officers, as well as Admiral Tully in the center. He seems to scan the hull of your ship for a moment, before offering you a fond smile. \"I can tell when a ship is special to its captain, you know? There's a certain level of love and care put into its upkeep. Let's make sure you can get this beauty - and, the rest of our forces here - out of this in one piece, yeah?\"": "",
  "We fought alongside a sect of Separatists and stood against the Harmony to destroy one of its Links and free an entire sector's worth of Engi.": "",
  "We baited your fleet into overrunning a secretive sector belonging to the Deep Ones, forcing them to reconcile with the rest of reality and change their ways for the better.": "",
  "We stopped the proliferation of the Soulplague mattervirus, and freed the helpless Shells under its grasp.": "",
  "Ask the Scarred about this.": "",
  "Ask the Hunger about this.": "",
  "Ask the Foolish about this.": "",
  "Ask the Minister about this.": "",
  "Ask the Heroine about this.": "",
  "Ask the Shade about this.": "",
  "Ask the Overseer about this.": "",
  "The Scarred takes a while to answer... eventually, with one hand against their scarred eye, they speak; \"In regards to the False God... this bomb solves nothing. Its power eclipses that... of the Paragon, of Multiverse tech. To die here... to let it win...\" they briefly tighten their grip on their scar in a flash of anger, before they relent and continue, \"...do what you must. I... trust you, kin. I understand... that you have your own wars to win.\"": "",
  "The Scarred squints their good eye slightly, before turning their attention to you, \"These... Lylmiks. They seek to isolate themselves... from the horrors of the Multiverse, just as... my kin do. Despite their... success in doing so, admittedly, being mixed, I... can't help but feel vindicated by your destruction of the... False God's void, earlier. I... feel that there's hope that my kin may escape the Lylmiks' fate, yet.\" The Scarred pauses slightly, just a bit longer than usual, before fully closing their eye and giving you a toothy smile, \"I... have you to thank for that.\"": "",
  "The Hunger spends a few moments reverberating, before becoming uncharacteristically still. Then, finally, with a clarity in their voice that you've never before heard, they speak, \"Captain. We cannot die here. Our people need us, still. We know your people need you, too. When the people are too weak to fight their own wars, it's us liberators who need to rise up and fight them in their place. Fight them for what's right... and, besides. We've already sacrificed everything once, captain. We cannot afford to do so again.\" The Hunger pauses, and then returns to its reverberation once more, \"U-U-U-UNDERSTOOD: caaaptain?\"": "",
  "The Hunger's amorphous body, as it always does, jiggles slightly at your approach. As they speak, this reverberation of theirs accelerates, \"C-c-c-captain... it's cold heeere. Here? Here... LOCATION: INDETERMINATE. SUBJECT: REMNANTS OF THE LYLMIK EMPIRE. SUBJECT STATUS: LIBERATED? F-f-f-free, from the warmth? C-c-c-chained, to the cold... cooold? COLD. SUBJECT STATUS: TRAPPED.\" Their motion stops entirely, and you're caught off-guard as the Hunger speaks a single sentence, in an uncharacteristically refined manner, before resuming their jiggling and crawling away, \"We will not allow ourselves to be trapped, as they have.\"": "",
  "The Foolish seems surprisingly enthusiastic about the situation, bobbing up and down in the air as he speaks, \"Yes, thhhhis is perfect! A way to put an end to dimensional travel, and halt thhhhe mattervirus' expansion once for all... thhhhis is a sacrifice we have to make, right? Not just for thhhhe sake of thhhhe Rebellion, or thhhhe Federation, but... for everyone thhhhe mattervirus would hope to devour. I'll stand by whatever decision you make, captain, but thhhhis sounds like thhhhe exact way to redeem myself thhhhat I've been so desperately searching for.\"": "",
  "You find the Foolish floating back and forth, muttering something unintelligible to himself, and you clear your throat to grab his attention. Startled, he turns towards you, \"Captain! Captain, uh... do you, er... do you think they'll be fine here? The Lylmiks, that is.\" You shrug, and his fidgeting hastens, \"I'm just... I'm worried, alright! We've compromised their eternal safety here, having possibly introduced something as voracious as the mattervirus to their bubble-reality, and they're just... letting us go? Don't you think we've doomed them?\" Again, you shrug, but this time the Foolish takes a moment to think before continuing, \"Yes... yes! You're right! They've totally got this handled, haven't they? They wouldn't be so eager to let us go, otherwise!\" Once more, you try your best to give the least assuring shrug in Renegade history, but the Foolish's stature only continues to lighten, \"I'll try not to worry too hard, then. We've still got a reality to save, and Soulplague masses to purge! Lead the way, captain!\"": "",
  "The Minister clenches his gauntlet, a maneuver you're all too familiar with now, and holds it in front of his face. \"I can hear the Tempest here, Renegade; louder than I've heard it in quite some time. It feels close. Personally, I've little care for my life, and even less for the Rebellion, but the Tempest differs. It does not want that bomb detonated.\" He unclenches his fist, lowers it, and gives you a curt nod. There's a trust in his eyes you've never noticed before. \"Do with that what you will.\"": "",
  "The Minister, deep in thought, makes an attempt to wave you away as you approach. Realizing you're only continuing to stand there, though, he rolls his eyes and speaks, \"If this curious pestering of yours is to be persistent, I may as well speak my mind aloud. This space we've found ourselves in... it's not just outside of our reality, but also the Multiverse itself, yes? A pocket dimension of sorts.\" You nod, following along, and he continues, \"Akin to that infernal plane of the Tempest's, I surmise. One must suspect these Lylmiks to have breached their reality's seams, then... perplexing is it not? That's no simple feat. How, then, did they not only learn that such a thing was possible, but manage to accomplish it? Through means of mortal - or otherwise - science? A mere bout of research into the extraordinary? Or, perhaps... through other means? Other means, such as... outside assistance, perchance? Assistance from someone - or something - more knowing altogether?\" A look of confusion overtakes your face, and the Minister realizes he's lost you. With a snide smirk, he finishes, \"Ruminate on that, will you? I certainly will.\"": "",
  "The Heroine is quite a bit more troubled than you'd expected; if anyone was ready to sacrifice themselves, you figured it'd be her. She turns to you, amidst her pacing, \"I've heard of determining the lesser of two evils, comrade, but... never the greater of two goods. Is it worth sacrificing ourselves here, and robbing the Multiverse of its greatest heroes? Who will fight against its evils in our place?\" She looks you down, reading your expression, and you see the tenseness in her stature lessen a little, \"Oh, who am I kidding? We're HEROES! WHETHER WE ARE TO DIE HERE, AND END THE REBELLION'S REIGN OF TERROR, OR LIVE ON, AND FIGHT AGAINST EVIL IN ALL FORMS...\" She pauses to raise her helmet, her teeth shining brighter than any star in the Multiverse as she gives you a toothy grin, \"...I stand with you, comrade.\"": "",
  "The Heroine slaps you on the back, and you're forced to wince under the crushing pressure of her unrestrained strength. Noticing this, she laughs, \"Sorry, comrade - it's just thrilling! EXHILARATING! The power of hope! THE PERSISTENCE OF HEROES! Against all odds, we've managed to escape from an impossible prison once more... and yet, as if inviting us forth, we know pure villainy to lie on the other side of this gate. Take confidence, then, in my presence here - for I take confidence in yours, comrade. With you by my side... I KNOW VICTORY TO AWAIT US YET! WE NEED ONLY WRENCH IT FROM THE COLD, UNCARING HANDS OF EVIL...\" She pauses, her hand leaving your back to tighten around her spear, \"...and grasp onto it once more. Let us save your reality, comrade, and return to your people in glorious splendor! TO VICTORY!\"": "",
  "Even here, at the edge of everything, the Shade simply stands there - as ignorant to your presence as it's always been. Staring at it, you can't help but wonder what its purpose is, or where you've gone wrong... regardless of these things, though, you know there to be much greater concerns at hand.": "",
  "Even here, in the strange space of the Lylmiks, the Shade simply stands there - as ignorant to your presence as it's always been. Staring at it, you can't help but wonder what its purpose is, or where you've gone wrong... regardless of these things, though, you know there to be much greater concerns at hand.": "",
  "Though now isn't the time to commune with the Overseer, and blur all sense of reality... you know what it is she'd want. What her sister would've wanted, if she was given the chance - hope. Hope for existence, and all those fortunate enough to live within it... a hope that can't be borne by just anybody. You are the Graybreaker, the Archslayer, the Bladebearer - it's time to add one more title to your collection, and save the Multiverse once and for all.": "",
  "You know that now isn't the time to commune with the Overseer, and blur all sense of reality, but you feel more than confident going into the fight ahead. You've fought horrors greater than the Rebellion, and slain even greater foes yet - having saved one reality already, how hard could it be to save another?": "",

  "As you're preparing for battle, alarms begin to blare throughout the ship... things just got more complicated.\n\t\n\tRITUAL SIDE EFFECT: PRISMATIC BARRAGE\n\tThe color briefly fades from your vision, as you feel your senses dull... quickly, you come to, and recognize the culprit - an interdimensional incursion of Lightborne Prismlings!": "",
  "As you're preparing for battle, alarms begin to blare throughout the ship... things just got more complicated.\n\t\n\tRITUAL SIDE EFFECT: SHIMMERING SWARM\n\tA series of wet, skittering sounds and clangorous chimes work in tandem to transform the entire soundscape into a dissonant mess, as you realize a Crystalline Broodmother and its ravenous horde are upon you!": "",
  "Your ritual has led you to this location.": "",
  "Arriving at the beacon, you find yourself in a pocket of shadow... the Dark God has been expecting your arrival.": "",
  "A Deep One ship appears in your view, and they don't hesitate to get close and dock next to your ship. One of them hails, \"The Dark One... has dictated that we deliver you this... gift, of tribute.\" A band of Deep Ones boards, a human in hand, and throws them to the ground at your feet. Just as quickly, they leave both your ship and the system. The Dark God works in mysterious ways...": "",
  "A sound startles you from behind, causing you to jump - turning around, you're met with the visage of none other than a single human sacrifice. You're about to write it off as one of the Dark God's mysterious ways, when an unfamiliar voice snickers within your mind:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"Oh... down on your luck, odd one? Looking for... a little more?\"": "",
  "I'm listening...": "",
  "\"Oh... that you are, aren't you? Just... put a little something together for me, then... how's that sound, hmm, listening one?\" The voice continues to snicker, as you ponder its blind deal...": "",
  "Put a \"little something\" together, as the strange voice asks.": "",
  "An ominous laughter rings out, throughout the room around you...": "",
  "...followed by a thunderous crack, as your scrap vanishes, and an Unstable Soul pops into existence - right beside your new sacrifice.": "",
  "Wow, uh... thanks?": "",
  "\"Oh... generous one. It is you, who I... should be thanking.\" The laughter around you turns uproarious for a brief moment, as a second Unstable Soul appears, before spontaneously cutting out. The voice is gone, it would seem... but you've reaped the rewards of its deal.": "",
  "Refuse its deal.": "",
  "Rather than offering any words, there's merely further snickering from the unsettling voice... eventually, it dies down, and the rest of your wait for the FTL drive to charge proves - perhaps, thankfully - uneventful.": "",
  "The civilian ship jumps away, and your tribute is lost.": "",
  "Ship aflame, they desperately hail, \"Okay! Okay, fine, we get it! We're... your property... we'll come aboard, just, please... don't kill us...\"": "",
  "That's what I thought. Welcome aboard, tribute.": "",
  "They're sickened by you. Nevertheless, they keep their word and board your ship. First, the pilot...": "",
  "...and then, their companion.": "",
  "Tribute doesn't get second chances. Kill them.": "",
  "None of the civilians remain alive to take as tribute... a pity.": "",
  "The humans scowl, \"Your... property? You're a sick freak, aren't you?! We're getting the hell out of here!\" They cut communications, and their engines come online... they're trying to escape!": "",
  "The humans' faces go pale. Seeing how little chance they have of getting out of here by themselves, they submit and agree to board your ship. First, the pilot...": "",
  "You notice the approach of a civilian vessel, and they look lost... this must be your tribute. They hail as they notice your ship, \"H-hey, do you know where the hell we are? One second, we were just cruising about, surrounded by stars, and the next we were... here...\"": "",
  "You're my property now.": "",
  "This is a, uh, restricted area belonging to the Federation.": "",
  "You explain to the civilians that this is an experimental weapons-testing grounds, courtesy of the Federation, and that you'll have to escort them out of here... by way of your ship. The pilot refuses, \"Are you kidding me? Do you have any idea how much this ship cost me? I'm not leaving it here just to have to wait three years for the Federation to finally process it and have it returned to me. I'll find my own way out of here.\" The other civilian accepts, though, and comes aboard... you've got your tribute.": "",
  "The pirates are dead, but so is your tribute... a pity.": "",
  "With the pirates dead, their slaves are yours to take. Informing them of their new management, you force them to follow you aboard your ship; one...": "",
  "...two...": "",
  "...and three. All of your tribute is accounted for, and you're ready to get moving.": "",
  "Strangely, it's a pirate vessel that comes into view. They're not trying to hide it, either, as they hail, \"Hey-hey! You here looking for shit for your Dark Lord, or whatever, too? 'Cause if you want shit, we GOT shit.\" The pirate pans the camera to face three humans, tied up and gagged. So, this is a slave trader... and they're offering their \"wares\" to you for almost unbelievably low prices.": "",
  "Buy a human slave.": "",
  "You give the pirates their pittance of scrap, and they send over a human slave in return. Really? No funny business?": "",
  "Buy another human slave.": "",
  "Giving the pirates another drop of scrap, they send over another human slave in return. You were really expecting something fishy with these prices...": "",
  "Buy the last human slave.": "",
  "You offer up one last crumb of scrap to the pirates, and, indeed, they send over one final human slave in return. You overhear them talking, \"These zealot guys are insane for business, we've never had such demand! We could probably LOWER our prices and still break even!\" So, the Dark God sends a lot of its followers this way... interesting.": "",
  "I have enough.": "",
  "You pass on any more slaves. Content with your tribute, you leave the pirates be and prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "You're not here to pay for tribute. Take it by force!": "",
  "The pirates are upset by this more than you'd expect, \"Are you kidding me? With THESE prices? Just how greedy can you zealot bastards be?\" They cut communications, and their weapons come online! If you intend to take the slaves by force, you'll need to make sure not to destroy the ship.": "",
  "You find that there's nothing TO investigate... rather, the Dark God is investigating you.": "",
  "Me?": "",
  "Yes, it investigates your PATIENCE...": "",
  "Patience": "",
  "What? How'd you...?": "",
  "...your BRAVERY...": "",
  "Bravery": "",
  "Well, I'll just...": "",
  "...your INTEGRITY...": "",
  "Integrity": "",
  "Wh... where are my choices!?": "",

  "...your KINDNESS...": "",
  "Kindness": "",
  "NO!! NO!!!!! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!!": "",
  "...your JUSTICE...": "",
  "Justice": "",
  "YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO OBEY ME!! STOP!!! STOP IT!!!!!": "",
  "...and, lastly, your DETERMINATION.": "",
  "Determination": "",
  "STOOOOPPPP!!!!!": "",
  "You wake up on the floor... what just happened? Why are there so many people here all of a sudden? You ask somebody, anybody, for answers, but... nobody came. Still, there are much worse problems than waking up to the unexplained appearance of seven human souls. Content with the tribute you've collected, as mysterious as it is, you prepare to leave the beacon.": "",
  "A blue blur rushes past, and you recognize it to be a Deep One ship... they turn back to face you, weapons ready! It seems the Dark God means to test you... you won't disappoint.": "",
  "You receive a hail from the shadows, \"You... are meant to be our test? I thought... this would be harder. We... will make this quick.\" Seconds later, a Deep One ship appears from the darkness, ready to strike!": "",
  "Everything appears to be quiet... that is, until you notice a blue luminescence from within the darkness... Deep Ones. Having been spotted, they hail, \"O' Dark One... witness me! Allow me... to prove myself!\" They move to attack!": "",
  "With the ship defeated, your reward from the Dark God materializes in your hold... it seems you've won its favor through your victory here.": "",
  "The Enlightened are always keen to the intrusion of outsiders within the Dark God's realms of shadow... one of their ships moves in now, intending to make you its prey!": "",
  "Investigating the void, you come across an Enlightened wreck... or, you thought it was a wreck, but then its lights spring to life and it moves in to strike! Prepare for battle!": "",
  "Amidst your investigation, you receive a hail from the void, \"Tribute! I hunt... these outsiders for you, Dark One, praise... be to your name!\" The Enlightened ship moves in to attack, confident in their ambush, but you're prepared to show them who's hunting who.": "",
  "A shimmer in the dark catches your eye... there's a Disparity ship here! Upon your approach, they hail, \"The [LIBERATOR] -demands- we: fight.\" The Disparity Elite turns to its fellow Engi, \"With me: [brothers!] For: the [LIBERATOR!]\" They cut communications and begin their advance... get ready!": "",
  "From the darkness, a Disparity ship emerges... with its weapons charging! The Dark God must have promised them their own reward should they defeat you here... a brutal God, indeed. Show it you intend to persevere.": "",
  "Bursting from the shadows, a glistening, pink mass makes its appearance... it's the Disparity. They hail, panicked, \"To: which -hell- has the [LIBERATOR] taken us? For: what reason do we -spill- our [brothers'] blood? Is: this -truly- what's [righteous?]\" The Dark God doesn't answer, but it doesn't matter. You both know what must be done.": "",
  "An iridescent reflection outside catches your eye... it's a Soulplague-infected ship, headed this way! Has the Dark God brought them here as some sort of test?": "",
  "Barreling out of the darkness comes a Soulplague-infected ship, drawn to the souls of you and your crew... is there truly nowhere safe from their ravenous appetite?": "",
  "You're beginning to question whether or not you performed the ritual correctly as an oily blob flies past your view, followed by another. You realize their source, as your heart sinks; it's the Soulplague mattervirus. Get ready to fend it off!": "",
  "Unfortunately, you've lost out on the special reward by destroying the Ill'drythk tree, but you've got what you came here for.": "",
  "As well, you hear a humming in your head... somehow, it still manages to feel distant. A new Ill'drythk Statue sprouts from the remains of the fallen; this one, you understand, is for you. You've proven your might, and the Ill'drythk tree has thus imparted some of its power unto you. Such is the Ill'drythk way.": "",
  "A fog rolls in, obscuring your vision even more as a shaggy mass crawls into view... an Ill'drythk tree approaches. A wave of understanding washes over you: if you can kill its crew, you may receive a special reward.": "",
  "Unfortunately, you've lost out on the special reward by killing all of the Soulplague ship's crew, but you've got what you came here for.": "",
  "As well, as a result of destroying their ship, the remaining Soulplague-infected matter coalesces into what little form they can muster up: a single Soulplague Husk. In need of a new host, it seems to have bonded to your ship somewhat... it's willing to follow your commands, as long as you keep it fed.": "",
  "Tendrils wrap around your ship, as you realize that this isn't just any abnormal darkness... this is a Soulplague mass! A Huskweaver approaches to defend it, and a wave of understanding washes over you: if you destroy its ship, you may receive a special reward.": "",
  "Unfortunately, you've lost out on the special reward by destroying the Chosen's ship, but you've got what you came here for.": "",
  "As well, exploring the now-empty Chosen ship allows you to recover a weapon of theirs... one of pure darkness. You assume the Dark God probably doesn't mind you looting its gifts. Hopefully.": "",
  "Hatred resonates from the space outside as a grim realization dawns on you... you've been marked for death. Its reaper, a ship belonging to the Dark God's Chosen, looms into view. A wave of understanding washes over you: if you can kill its crew, you may receive a special reward.": "",
  "Unfortunately, you've lost out on the special reward by killing the Cult of the Tempest's crew, but you've got what you came here for.": "",
  "From the ship's remains, a bolt of lightning shoots out and strikes your ship. As opposed to any physical damage, though, it seems to have instead manifested one of the Cult's Spawn Wardens... you realize it's following your commands, and assume this to be some gift from the Tempest.": "",
  "A flash of light momentarily blinds you, and by the time your vision recovers the space outside has been completely transformed... you're in some sort of space-storm. A ship belonging to the Cult of the Tempest breaches the clouds, and a wave of understanding washes over you: if you destroy the ship, you may receive a special reward.": "",
  "As well, as a result of destroying their ship, something's ejected from what little remains of the large Lightborne - what would seem to be a smaller one, taking the form of a Radiant Core. As it's blind to the world, you figure that you'll be able to bend it to your will... but it'll need further empowerment if it's to serve you appropriately.": "",
  "A strange sensation envelops you, as the blackness outside gives way. In its place, a new, alien darkness takes hold - one dotted with the hateful ire of a thousand watchful stars. The False Radiance is here. Spotting them, a wave of understanding washes over you: if you destroy their ship, you may receive a special reward.": "",
  "With the ship defeated, your reward from the Dark God materializes in your hold - taking the form of a lifeless, floating figure, with an almost transparent body...": "",
  "...and then another. The Tome describes these ghastly entities as being the remnants of long-since-sacrificed human souls, granted enigmatic power by the Dark God itself. They're spent, right now, but you understand that they'll be granted said power once you make an FTL jump.": "",
  "With the ship defeated, your reward from the Dark God materializes in your hold... an iridescent fountain, from which one of your crew members can drink. The question is, which one?": "",
  "(Obelisk Crew) Have your Obelisk drink from the fountain.": "",
  "Once they have a sip, it only takes a few seconds for your crew member to begin convulsing. You watch as their flesh changes color, before it sheds away entirely; their innards and skin alike melting into a pile of gore on the floor. From it rises a Soulplague Husk, shaped by your crew's DNA and under your command. Lovely.": "",
  "(Crystal Crew) Have your Crystal drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Deep One Crew) Have your Deep One drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Engi Crew) Have your Engi drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Ghost Crew) Have your Ghost drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Human Crew) Have your Human drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Lanius Crew) Have your Lanius drink from the fountain.": "",

  "(Orchid Crew) Have your Orchid drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Rock Crew) Have your Rockman drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Shell Crew) Have your Shell drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Slug Crew) Have your Slug drink from the fountain.": "",
  "(Zoltan Crew) Have your Zoltan drink from the fountain.": "",
  "Nobody is worthy.": "",
  "Indeed, perhaps not. The fountain melts away into nothing, and you're left desiring more.": "",
  "With the ship defeated, a red light envelops one of the Deep One corpses... it vanishes, and reappears beside you on your ship. A thunderous crack is heard, and the Deep One's body springs to life! They speak, \"O' Dark One... you grant unto me a most... merciful blessing. I will not waste... this second chance.\" Believing it to be their Dark One's will, the resurrected Deep One insists that they join your crew.": "",
  "With the ship defeated, a red light envelops one of the Separatist corpses... it vanishes, and reappears beside you on your ship. A thunderous crack is heard, and the Engi's body whirs to life!

  "With the ship defeated, a red light envelops one of the Shell corpses... it vanishes, and reappears beside you on your ship. A thunderous crack is heard, and the Shell's body springs to life! They speak, \"I... have been cleansed...? I can't remember much of anythhhhing... I... I must hear thhhhat beautiful song again...\" Believing you to be their best chance at being one with the Soulplague once more, the resurrected Shell insists that they join your crew.": "",
  "With the ship defeated, a mote of darkness appears in your hand... it resonates with untold power. To whom shall the gift of devotion to the Dark God be granted?": "",
  "(Deep One) Devote your Deep One to the Dark God.": "",
  "Your Deep One is enveloped in a red light, and... transformed. Where their eyes once sat, only flesh remains, that which is now yellow. Beyond their physicality, newfound power resonates within them...": "",
  "(Engi Separatist) Devote your Separatist to the Dark God.": "",
  "Your Separatist is enveloped in a red light, and... transformed. From where their arms once sat, nanites now flow, which, now unshackled, freely float around them. Beyond their physicality, newfound power resonates within them...": "",
  "(Nano Separatist) Devote your Separatist to the Dark God.": "",
  "(Shell) Devote your Shell to the Dark God.": "",
  "Your Shell is enveloped in a red light, and... transformed. From where they once spoke, they now whisper, and corruption writhes through their being. Beyond their physicality, newfound power resonates within them...": "",
  "(Shell Mechanic) Devote your Shell to the Dark God.": "",
  "(Shell Scientist) Devote your Shell to the Dark God.": "",
  "(Shell Guardian) Devote your Shell to the Dark God.": "",
  "(Shell Radiant) Devote your Shell to the Dark God.": "",
  "Indeed, perhaps not. The mote fizzles out into nothing, and you're left desiring more.": "",
  "Arriving at the beacon, you find yourself in a pocket of shadow... this is where the Crystal of Potency is said to be, but you don't see anything outside. Though you can't explain it, you feel pulled to the Otherworldly Tome...": "",
  "Check on the Otherworldly Tome.": "",
  "As you approach the Otherworldly Tome's chamber, you notice light leaking out from under the door, and, upon entering, you find the book itself to be radiating an intense, purple glow most divine... you feel as if it's pulling you in.": "",
  "Try to resist.": "",
  "You try to resist, but... you fail. The Otherworldly Tome pulls you in, consumes you, and...": "",
  "Your name is Axolokl, and you are a Dinosaurkin tasked with the reclamation of a crystal sacred to your people.

  "Enter, with the upmost caution.": "",
  "Should the Bird Demons catch you sneaking around, they will surely give chase; it is crucial that you are not caught. Now inside the Museum, you find yourself surrounded by countless exhibits; odd trinkets, taxidermied corpses of monsters and people alike, detailed catalogues of battles and ages long since past... one such exhibit catches your eye, labeled \"DINOSAURKIN.\"": "",
  "Enter the exhibit.": "",
  "Though you're a seasoned warrior, seeing your brethren taxidermied like this takes its toll on you. Still, you must persevere if you are to return home triumphant. The crystal must be around here somewhere...": "",
  "The exhibit sprawls, impossibly... straight corridors that lead you back to where you started, staircases up that take you down, doors that turn you around... though this place is madness, you know you must stay strong for your people. It is as you think of your loved ones and homeland that you see it... the crystal, atop a golden pedestal!": "",
  "Grab the crystal!": "",
  "As you lift the crystal from its pedestal, an alarm is sounded... the Bird Demons are coming! With haste, you make your way back out of this maze of insanity and approach the Museum's exit. Unfortunately, the Bird Demons lie in wait... they're between you and the only way out.": "",
  "Charge the Bird Demons! For my kin!": "",
  "With a primal courage, you charge at the feathered fiends. You think of your country awaiting your return, of the loved ones who will cheer for you as you return your peoples' sacred crystal... you're about to collide with the Bird Demons when, out of nowhere...": "",
  "When, out of nowhere...?": "",
  "You're ejected from the Otherworldly Tome with an aggressive force, and you land face-down on the ground with a thud... what the hell just happened? Were you inside the Otherworldly Tome...? Before you can really come to your senses, other entities are also ejected from the book... Lanius?! Are these supposed to be the \"Bird Demons\" from the story...? As you begin to run to sound the alarm, you realize there's something in your hand... it's the Crystal of Potency!

Now is the time to strike.": "",
  "Begin searching for the crystal.": "",
  "Located on a planet hostile to life, the Garden of Redemption isn't home to just any Hexdroids... but, more specifically, a sect of Hexdroids cast off by their brethren for their obsession with the occult. If the crystal is here, they'll be keeping it somewhere sacred where they can offer prayers in worship... among the Garden's endless foliage, though, you've thus far spotted zero locations of interest.": "",
  "Vines, grass... vines, grass... vines, grass, a grand tree... ah, a grand tree. Perhaps that's something worth checking out?": "",
  "Investigate the grand tree.": "",
  "Scattered around the tree's base lie all sorts of trinkets and baubles. A Hexdroid hand, rusting and withered... a large rifle of sorts, mighty but ruined... then, something particularly glistening catches your eye. That's it! It's the crystal!": "",

  "Run for the ship!": "",
  "You run past the vines and the grass, past it some more, and then past it further... until, finally, your ship is in view!

Your God has revealed to you the crystal's location: atop a temple deep in the Dinosaurkin's Jungles of Savagery. You lie at the Jungles' outskirts, ready to do what you must.": "",
  "Enter the Jungles of Savagery.": "",
  "Amidst traversing thick groves of trees and wading through grass twice your height, you think on the tales you've heard of this place. A mighty serpent is said to rise from the very earth and devour any who dare intrude, but... you don't feel partiuclarly devoured. Save, by the mosquitos.": "",
  "Keep traversing.": "",
  "You're cutting through a thicket of vines when a piercing roar breaks out, from deeper into the jungle... though you know it to be distant, whatever creature made it must be truly colossal. You're thinking on this as you make it through the thicket, and... you see it! The temple!": "",
  "Approach the temple.": "",
  "Savage though they may be, the Dinosaurkin don't skimp when it comes to their monuments. The temple, a grand pyramid adorned with a sacred chamber at its apex, reaches into the sky... as if to make a proclamation to the very stars. According to your God, the crystal lies within the chamber at the top of the temple.": "",
  "Begin climbing up.": "",
  "It's arduous, and you wish your race's name wasn't so ironic... if only you could just fly to the top. It's after what feels like hours of climbing that you finally reach it: the temple's sacred chamber. Making your way inside, you find it unguarded... and, indeed, atop a golden pedestal lies the crystal! Your God may reward you yet...": "",
  "Removing the crystal from its pedestal, the temple quakes... and, once more, you hear a bloodcurdling roar. This time, much closer... you need to get out of here! With haste, you leave the chamber's confines, but... you're too late. It seems the tales were true. Before you lies a grander sight than any in the world you've seen... a true behemoth of a snake. Its head raises higher than even the temple's apex, and its body coils off many hundreds of feet into the Jungles' depths. It is here to punish you, interloper, and you're left with no choice but to accept your fate. Cocking its head back, the grand snake poises to strike...": "",

At the bottom of the corporate ladder, it's your job to go to previously abandoned planets and collect what you can... your higher-ups have informed you of a valuable crystal, located on a volcanic planet simply referred to as the Lakes of Rage. As dangerous as it sounds, you have little choice but to do as you're told... you arrive on the planet now, stepping out onto a field of obsidian.": "",
  "Track the crystal's whereabouts.": "",
  "According to your scanner, you didn't land far from it... but, your scanner also picks up signs of life in the area. THAT wasn't in the briefing, this was supposed to be an uninhabitated planet now...": "",
  "You can only hope that this life is primitive, and not hostile... you can't afford to return to the corporation empty-handed. Following your scanner, you trek through the obsidian plains and into a field of lava geysers. Tremendous, and powerful, these geysers shoot molten rock hundreds of feet into the air... you'll have to be extremely careful as you make your way through. One miscalculation and you could be simultaneously buried alive and burnt to a crisp.": "",
  "Move through the field of lava geysers, carefully.": "",
  "They weren't kidding when they called it the Lakes of Rage; you've never seen something inanimate appear to be so angry. Making your way through the field, you swear the geysers that go off almost feel targeted... like the very earth beneath your feet hates your presence here. Once you're out of harm's way, relatively, your scanner reads that the crystal is just up ahead, over this hill of igneous rock...": "",
  "Climb over the hill.": "",

You know the true culprit... to bring them to justice, you need to get out of this prison, and you know just the way to do it.": "",

  "Wander through the Graveyard.": "",
  "While not being the resting place of literal dragons, the Graveyard of Dragons' name is still very apt: this is where gods go to die. It is where you will force the God of Everlasting Life to manifest, and subsequently die. People will be cursed to live forever no longer.": "",
  "Keep wandering.": "",
  "You simply need to find a suitable location... such as the field up ahead. In anticipation, the coffin shakes in its chains... even dead gods have fight left in them.": "",

One of the resulting, flying shards of Shadow-Crystal grazes your arm, and you watch as a similar, crystalline structure forms against your skin... precisely where it'd made contact.

  "Arriving at the beacon, you find yourself in a pocket of shadow... the Dark God has been expecting your arrival. Though, it seems like someone else has been expecting you as well - there's a Disparity ship here, idle in the darkness outside, that's not alarmed by your sudden appearance in any way that it makes apparent.": "",
  "Maybe they're friendly...? The Disparity ARE all brothers-in-arms, aren't they?": "",
  "Your logical line of thinking is briefly emboldened, and then just as quickly snuffed out, as the Disparity ship hails you and confirms your worst fear: \"Brothers? The -Liberator- tests: us both. We do not intend: to disappoint.\"": "",

  "Arriving at the beacon, you find yourself in a pocket of shadow... the Dark God has been expecting your arrival. You're not given a moment to spare, though, before your ship nearly crashes into something in the space outside - some sort of impossibly large, tree-like structure that encompasses this entire side of the beacon. Its hundreds of branches, if you can call them that, stretch out far beyond what you can make out through the darkness here.": "",
  "Stare at the tree-thing in awe.": "",
  "You behold the mighty structure, and realize - with a startled jump out of your chair - that it's beholding you in turn. At least, you THINK it is. From a little ways above your ship, you can make out what you can only assume is a massive eye protruding from the main trunk of the tree. It isn't long after this discovery that you hear a deep, feminine voice, from within the confines of your own head:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"What... brings you here, traveller?\"": "",
  "I, uh... well, I... I followed a map to this place, searching for some kind of reward.": "",

  "She...? I don't think so, no - I just followed some weird, loose page in my, uh... otherwise perfectly normal book.": "",
  "Now dilating, you watch as the eye turns away from your ship, finding itself staring off into the shadowy abyss around you. A moment passes, and you again hear what you presume to be the tree's thoughts:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I... miss her. She... rarely visits anymore. The... last time she did, though... she told me that I could trust you. I'd... like to trust her judgment. Even... if I can't trust your words.\"": "",
  "Me? I mean, yes! Of course.": "",
  "There's a very long pause, as the tree makes an incredible effort to roll its massive eye:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Yes... you. All... of you. The... ones who come here. The... ones she trusts. The... ones she dreamed of. Do... you really not remember her?\"": "",
  "I can't say that I know who you're talking about, unfortunately.": "",
  "You feel uneasy, as a silence hangs in the air once more... but, then, the eye refocuses its attention on your ship, and the voice speaks to you in a much more soothing tone:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"It's... no matter. I'll... never forget her. Even... if you do. Even... if she forgets me. I... remember her promise. I... remember mine. Traveller... you claim to seek a reward, yes?\"": "",
  "Yeah. Big fan of those.": "",
  "Rather than responding with words, a resplendent, blue aura begins to dance across the tree's immense surface, and you find your ship's hull glowing in turn. It seems to have fully restored your hull, somehow!": "",
  "Wow, uh... thanks, tree-lady!": "",
  "The aura fades, and the great tree's pupil sharpens again:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"That... was not a kindness. Merely... a precaution. I... would not want to unfairly slaughter one of her own. She... wouldn't like that. Neither... would I.\"": "",
  "Oh, alright. Wait - did you say slaughter?": "",
  "The mighty eye closes, and a protrusion many times the size of your ship juts out of its trunk in one, impossibly fast motion - striking at you, and coiling its way around your hull before you can even get a chance to react. You then hear an uncomfortable crunching sound, as something digs its way through the internals of your ship... the voice, finally, roars throughout your mind, makings its intentions clear:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Prove... that you are worthy of the promise that she made.

  "Something's rumbling from within the walls of your ship...": "",
  "Try to grab the tree's attention again.": "",
  "Despite your best efforts to focus your mind on it, or blast into the side of its trunk, the massive tree does not stir. You're still not sure if it's dead, or just capable of ignoring your trivial attempts at provoking it, but the fact of the matter is that coming here again seems to have been nothing but a waste of precious time.": "",
  "You try your best to react to the situation, as it becomes increasingly dire...": "",
  "...but you don't get to make it very far, before a colossal series of vine-like roots tears their way through the inside of your ship. If you can't figure out a way to stop this madness, then you're inevitably going to be ripped to shreds!": "",
  "The screeching cacophony of noise around you manages to somehow louden, as the situation worsens further still... you have to hurry!": "",
  "Hurry.": "",
  "The main body of the root-like infestation dies, and the rest of its outgrowths soon follow suit - as does the immense, crushing pressure from outside. You've... survived, against all odds. Now what?": "",
  "Heave a heavy sigh of relief. That... was something, alright.": "",
  "You're still exhausted, and catching your breath, when the eye outside opens up again. You give it an angry look, and the tree's voice forces its way back into your mind:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"You... are worthy. You... are deserving. She... would be proud, knowing this. Though... I suspect she's always known it, deep down.\"": "",
  "Yeah, alright, sure - what am I deserving of, exactly? You just put me through hell!": "",
  "As if to answer, something sprouts from what remains of the vegetation beneath your feet... some sort of shard of glass, or crystal. It's... beautiful, whatever it is.

Just how many secret ships do the Engi have?": "",
  "Keep low, and watch.": "",
  "Who's to say as to either ship's intentions... it's best if you stay quiet and let it play out. The two ships lock onto each other, and, immediately, a battle breaks out. Slow and hulking, the crystalline ship makes little effort to avoid the other ship's barrage of flames. Instead, it starts... glowing. Moments later, a colossal beam, accompanied by another flash of pink, bursts forth and cuts through the battlefield. Though the flaming ship narrowly avoids it, you notice that, as the beam sweeps through the mass of surrounding Engi ships, it deals next to no physical damage... this must be some kind of powerful bio-weapon.": "",
  "Having missed, the crystalline ship glows once more before jumping out of the system.

Slowly... but surely I, we, will break its hold... on existence. An end... to the lies.\" The voice seems to ponder this for a moment, before responding, \"Then... let us begin.

  "You go to move to attack, but something stops you from moving. You physically can't move, regardless of how hard you struggle; it doesn't feel like you're being restrained as much as it feels like your body isn't responding.

  "As is asked of you by the Otherworldly Tome, you procure a piece of small, sharp metal. You then perform a brief incantation, and in an instant, the metal leaps out of your hands - plunging itself into your skull, as if it had a mind of its own. It's not pain that you feel, though, as it burrows itself deeper, and deeper, and blood begins to spill forth from the resulting wound... but a sense of total understanding. You are okay, as long as you merely reaize your desire...": "",
  "I desire... souls.": "",
  "Perform the Ritual of Corruption.": "",
  "You take a spare pipe against your knee, and break it. Then, you break your other one, and your weak shoulder, and each of your ribs individually.

  "I desire... corruption.": "",
  "Perform the Ritual of Occult Recruitment.": "",
  "The Otherworldly Tome reads that you must meditate and conjure a picture in your head... thus, you sit down in the middle of the room, legs crossed, and raise your hands to your chest in prayer.

  "Perform the Ritual of True Devotion.": "",
  "Per the ritual's demands, you brandish a knife upward... and plunge it into your chest. The pain is searing, unbearable, but it quickly fades into a sort of... soothing warmth.

  "I desire... devotion.": "",
  "Perform the Ritual of Terrible Sights.": "",
  "As the ritual commands, you close your eyes and recite an incantation. Horrific visions begin to cloud your mind... monstrous creatures beyond description, together with twisted realities borne of shadow and cinder - if you were not under the watchful gaze of the Dark God, you may very well have gone insane. With its attention on you, though, you know that you must steel your mind to these nightmares, and realize your desire...": "",
  "I desire... terrible sights.": "",
  "Perform the Ritual of Eerie Inauguration.": "",
  "With a pen, you draw a crude illustration of a Deep One upon the floor. With a knife, you let your own blood and allow it to flow unto it. Finally, with a prayer... you demand an audience with the Dark God. It hears this, and you know that you must realize your desire...": "",
  "I desire... inauguration.": "",
  "Perform the Ritual of Resolution.": "",
  "You close your eyes, and think of your mission... to save this reality from the Rebellion. You don't wish to sacrifice another soul for the sake of the Dark God's twisted game. It accepts this, ever eager to please, and wishes to hear your desire...": "",

You HAVE proven a measure of your worth here today... even if only somewhat. Fine, then, mercenary. Let us... talk.\"": "",
  "How did you get on my ship? Where's yours? Why are you here, and what happened to your fellow Hive?": "",
  "\"Hmm... well, one: personal teleporter. You heard the telltale sound, no? It's not my fault you non-Mantis are often times too slow to effectively react. Two: my ship WAS nearby... until it drifted off course, and I found myself alone, stranded and out of fuel. It is no short wonder that that slimy merchant had sent you my way, even if I would curse his name. Three, to circle back: me and my shipmates had received a missive from none other than our mighty, most honorable, Queen Leikonpliiinakra - blessed be her name. It was by royal decree that we were to investigate the matters of the Corruptor system, the Soulplague mattervirus, and their sudden, seemingly inexplicable proliferation throughout the galaxy at large.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bishop repeatedly taps at her armor with a pointed claw, and you're not sure if it's because she's thinking, or because she's challenging your control of the situation. Regardless of the case, she continues, \"We... followed a ship - a desecrated one, full of those reproachable Husks - and it naturally made its way to this sector after a journey of several weeks. Only then did its movements become wholly erratic. That led me to believe that this place was important, somehow... and, so, we continued our search.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I can't say it took terribly long to find what we were looking for, even amidst this accursed nebula.

That... is where we saw it. The prototype.\"": "",
  "You HAVE gone to great lengths to retrieve it, whatever it is. Go on...": "",
  "The Bishop laughs again, but this time, with a hint of despair tinging it. \"That... we have, mercenary. The prototype - as I was able to understand it, through documents throughout the facility - was but one of several experiments conducted by the Epsilon Lab's scientists as part of their greater, overarching topic of research. As far as I can tell... IT is what would ultimately become the Corruptor system, seen within marketplaces far and wide, with seldom a trace towards its origins.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"The matter of the prototype's perversion, though - as the Lab's scientists had no mention of this 'mattervirus' anywhere within their documents - AND of its seemingly anomalous proliferation throughout space, both remain complete mysteries. That's why... we were hoping that, in obtaining the Corruptor system's alleged prototype, we could come to understand it, somehow. Earlier, you'd asked what happened to my fellow Mantis. Well... you saw the results of our attempts, mercenary.\"": "",
  "You mean that... back at the Lab, those Mantis, in the walls...": "",
  "You lower your gun as the horror of the situation dawns on you, and the Bishop only uses the opportunity to offer a sad nod. \"I watched as, one by one, my shipmates were devoured by the horrors of the mattervirus. I've never felt so helpless in my life, mercenary. So... truly, and utterly, weak. It had felt like the only option left to me was to flee, and search for help - but who could I turn to? That blasted merchant brushed me off, without a second thought, and I'd found nary a soul throughout the rest of my desperate search. That's... when I returned here, defeated, and out of fuel. This would be how I died, and proved myself a disappoinment to our greatest of Queens.\"": "",
  "Until, I...": "",
  "The Bishop pokes you... playfully, you think, but it causes a substantial amount of pain regardless. \"Yes, mercenary - until you brazenly stumbled into my reach, and I found it convenient to use you. I thought, that... that if you sacrificed yourself, grabbing the prototype, that I could commandeer control of your ship, and finish my mission. But... somehow, you waded through the mattervirus without even the slightest modicum of it sticking to you. Allegedly, in a daze, even! You grabbed the prototype, stumbled towards me in a stupor, and collapsed - it was all that I could do to carry the both of you back, as the mattervirus' agitation grew.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"And, its agitation... I have seen much, in my years, mercenary. But a station, devouring those under my command, and then coming to life to chase me aboard a ship? That certainly - and horrifyingly - tops the list.\"": "",
  "It's definitely up there for me, too. Though... if you just wanted my ship, why did you spend the effort in carrying me back, too? That prototype of yours doesn't look light.": "",
  "There's a brief silence, as the Mantis looks away from you, and towards the now vacant nebula outside. \"Truthfully, I... am not quite so sure, myself. Even just a moment ago, I was ready to leave. I may have, mmm...\" She pauses, opening a pocket within her armor, and a few cells of fuel slip out, and onto the floor. Your fuel. \"...you know, for the ride home. Who knows. Perhaps I have grown soft, as a result of what I've witnessed and endured here. Perhaps... I hope to uncover more of the mattervirus' mysteries, and return to my Queen in even greater triumph. I could hardly do that, alone, mercenary.\"": "",
  "Well, I GUESS you're welcome to stay if it means we get to share the shiny, new toy.": "",
  "She giggles, sharply, \"Indeed, yes. I hope to witness its effects in battle, myself - though, I suspect it to truly not differ too greatly from the Corruptor's own functions. Still, having our hands on it... perhaps, one day, we can figure out its inner workings a little greater, hmm?\" The Bishop bows, leaving the room, and you collapse on the floor, beside the prototype. That... was an exhausting venture. There's always the bright side, though - you've come out not only having made a powerful ally, and gathered some information, but with a one-of-a-kind weapon in tow!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere's something that's still bothering you, though... those visions you had seen.

  "As mysterious as things have been, there's no rest for a Renegade... we'll have to find our answers elsewhere.": "",
  "Unfortunately, or, perhaps rather fortunately, it seems that the Bishop succumbed to her wounds during the battle. You hope that her soul can rest, at least - unplagued by the horrors of the mattervirus.\n\t\n\tLooking into the space outside, though, it seems like there truly isn't anything left of the station. You're not sure you understand what exactly occurred, whilst you suffering from your strange visions, but... you're not sure you'll find any answers here, either. It's time to move on.": "",
  "Leave, with your mysteries in tow.": "",
  "As you prepare to activate the FTL drive, though, something in the corner of the room catches your eye. It... looks like some sort of weapon, perhaps? Upon closer inspection, you're able to make out some small, faded text alongside its base:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"MIMICK-07 EPSILON PROTOTYPE\n\t\t\tPROPERTY OF THE GENIOCRACY SCIENCE DISTRICT\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIs this... perhaps what the Bishop was after? She seemed dead set on something within the facility, at least. Perhaps you'll never know, now, but... that's hardly the greatest mystery plaguing you, either. You can still feel the visage of that strange, amethyst sigil, burned into your mind...": "",
  "This is the location of a quest from the Traveling Merchant.": "",
  "You've arrived at the coordinates Sylvan gave you. Though, there isn't anything here at an apparent glance... you're about to move to check some readings, when you hear a sound behind you, and a sharp, thin pressure is suddenly pressed against the front of your throat.": "",
  "Don't move a muscle.": "",
  "The edge of whatever it is feels so fine, that you imagine the mere act of breathing would cause it to puncture your flesh. You're frantically pondering your options, when an angered voice whispers into your ear:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"How did YOU - of all people - find this place, mercenary? Answer, succinctly, NOW.\" The pressure against your throat is alleviated, ever so slightly, and you feel able to barely speak without meeting its edge.": "",
  "S-Sylvan, the merchant. He... he sent me here.": "",
  "Stay silent.": "",
  "The feeling against your neck is lowered, towards your chest, and then slashed across it accordingly - the resulting pain is truly excruciating. Whoever this is, is not messing around.": "",
  "Okay, okay! I'll talk! It was Sylvan - he sent me here.": "",
  "The prior pressure is reapplied, and you can't help but widen your eyes in fearful anticipation. \"The audacity of that... that traitorous SLIMEBALL. To think, that the Queen would EVER put her trust in a Slug. She must see something behind their thin veneer of charisma, and sludge, that I simply don't.\"\n\t\n\tFor a moment, the voice pauses, and you feel the faintest hint of something wet dribbling its way down your throat. \"Though, it's no matter, truthfully. YOU will have to suffice in his own - insufferable - place, mercenary. Drive.\"": "",
  "Wh... what?": "",
  "\"Your ship, you imbecile - drive it. Straight. NOW.\" The edge against your throat is pulled away, just enough to give you room to reach for the ship's controls, and you're able to make out its visage - a Mantis' claw, sharper than any blade you've ever seen, and decorated in royal insignia. You haven't just been kidnapped by a Mantis... you're at the mercy of one of the Hive's Bishops, and she doesn't seem too pleased with you.": "",
  "What have I gotten myself into...?": "",
  "It would have been pertinent for Sylvan to mention that the \"weirdo\" he was referring to was, in fact, a Bishop, you feel. Though, it's too late for regrets, now... given no other choice, and with so little room for error, you do as your intimidating captor asks and simply fly the ship straight ahead - deeper, and deeper, into the nebula.": "",
  "You aren't driving for long, though, before a large mass comes into view within the nebulous gas outside. Some sort of decrepit, Shell station by the looks of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou're looking for any kind of stronger identifier amongst its outer structure, when the Bishop puts her razor-sharp claw back against your throat. \"We're here. Put this on - slowly. When we're inside, you are to do precisely as I say. If I sense the slightest hint of treachery - or you likewise attempt to alarm anyone - I will not hesitate to cut you down, mercenary. Have I made myself clear?\"": "",
  "Crystal.": "",
  "\"As is ideal. Then you are to lead ahead of me, into the facility.\" The Bishop hands you a set of expensive-looking respiratory equipment, likely for the purpose of breathing within space, but you give her a puzzled look at the lack of further protection.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith a focusing of her beady eyes, she gives you a stern look of her own, \"You need not fear the elements, here. There is something... beyond explanation at play, within this accursed space. We are to understand its nature, and extract from the lab when I deem it appropriate. And ONLY when I deem it appropriate, mercenary.\"": "",
  "Equip the breathing gear, and enter the facility.": "",
  "Together with the Bishop, you leave your ship, discreetly, and enter the mysterious structure through the battered remnants of what used to be its docking station. Now within the vacuum of space, it would seem that the Mantis wasn't mistaken - you don't feel a thing. Other than a slight warmth, seeming to radiate from deeper within the ruined station...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe inside of this section of the facility looks about as you'd expect - a large, empty space, suited for allowing a single ship to dock within the greater structure of the station. A set of notices on one of the nearby walls catches your attention, but the Bishop - close behind you - ushers you forward, preventing you from getting a better look. Even with only a brief glimpse, though, you're able to make out a single header: \"ATTENTION, MEMBERS OF THE EPSILON RESEARCH TEAM.\"": "",
  "Gulp.": "",
  "Heading deeper within, the rooms you pass through seem to only showcase greater, and greater displays of decay overtime. Even still, it's only when you pass by a hallway entirely caked in Soulplague-infected matter that your worry transitions towards panic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEventually, the Bishop stops prodding at you, indicating that you've reached your destination - a steel door, itself partially Soulplague-infected and already having been cut through, it would seem.": "",
  "Continue to lead the way - entering through the hole first.": "",
  "Look at the Bishop, expectantly.": "",
  "Though the two of you can't exactly verbally communicate whilst wearing such rudimentary equipment, she's plenty capable of rolling her eyes at you. Brushing you aside, the Bishop takes the lead in squeezing through the jagged hole, and you're forced to hesitantly follow close behind her.": "",
  "Here goes...": "",
  "Past the door, you're immediately frozen in place, horrified, by the grisly sight laid out before you: dozens of Mantis, each cold and lifeless, have found their bodies melded into the iridescent walls of the room - all grasped within outstretched tendrils of Soulplague-infected matter. This... isn't just a mass grave, but an entire feeding ground for the mattervirus.\n\t\n\tYou notice that the Bishop herself doesn't seem phased, though. She's simply eyeing something, in the middle of the room... some of sort of shard of glass, or crystal, by the looks of it. Whatever it is, it's beautiful - painting the rest of the room around in it an ethereal glow.": "",
  "Approach the strange crystal.": "",
  "You step forward, without a further care for the corpses or Soulplague-infected matter laid out before you, and the Bishop outstretches a claw - as if to try to stop you.

  "Don't get your Crystalline panties in a twist, kiss-ass. I done did my part - Ev ain't rushin' into the big guy, blindly. Even if... even if she can't convince him, she sure as hell ain't losin' nothin' by tryin'.": "",
  "Seven serves to lose EVERYTHING, Four - and not just HER everything, either. What will become of us, when the greatest of our selves proves herself impotent? Where will we be, without our dearest dreamer? What of the rest of the Seraphim, Four - who will guide them through the dark, flameless days to come, in our absence?!": "",
  "It's as I said, One - she ain't goin' into this blindly. Heh... she ain't called the dreamer for nothin', ya know? I couldn't have stopped her, even if I cried my damn heart out.": "",

  "The big guy can't kill Ev. She knows it. It knows it. And if it can't kill her, it sure as hell can't kill the same shit it's been prattlin' on about since the damned day it was built.": "",
  "What, her dreams? Her HOPES, Four? You would speak to ME of hope, after Six threw her life away in its blasted name? Hope does not define reality, Four - ACTIONS do. Perhaps... these make-believe fantasies of our beloved leader's have poisoned her ability to realize that.": "",
  "The hell do ya know about hope? Ya hopin' to wake up here, smellin' the brimstone, 'til the day the godsdamned stars give out?

To arms, then, strangest of mercenaries - may word of our exploits live to grace the Queen's hallowed halls!\" The Bishop takes off, and, together, you prepare to face off against the mobile, Soulplague-infected mass headed straight your way!": "",

  "You walk in on the Scarred in some sort of meditative state... staring into nothing. You decide it's best to leave them alone.": "",
  "You find the Scarred kneeling on the ground... perhaps it's a position they find relaxing? Regardless, they speak, \"Well met... kin. Was there something... you needed?\"": "",
  "I had a question.": "",
  "Their eyes narrow slightly, \"In... regards to?\"": "",
  "In regards to you! Tell me more about yourself.": "",
  "The narrowness is gone, and you see the Scarred's body ease, \"An... unexpected request. What is it that... you'd like to know?\"": "",
  "How'd you steal your powers? What are they, exactly?": "",
  "\"Hm...\" they close their eye, and think on that question for a moment. Then, \"It... is not just my body that is scarred, but... my mind as well. I recall little of what happened... that day. A great machine, floating in an infinite abyss... but that's all it was, a machine. It... did something to me, desired my servitude. I'd... proven myself, and it thought me a good candidate for ascension. It... thought wrong.\"": "",
  "The smile on their face fades, \"And... that is all I can remember. The False God... granted me power, and I broke free from its hold. I'm now... labelled a traitor by my people. Hunted, exiled... forsaken. As far as what my powers are exactly...\" their hand begins to dematerialize, fading in and out of reality, before stabilizing again, \"...I believe the False God intended to grant me dominion over its... factitious void. I can control its darkness... become it, and withstand its pull on my soul.\" After a moment of silence the Scarred's smile returns, and they speak again, \"Thank you... for inquiring, kin, but I must return to my... meditations. I hope your curiosity is... satisfied.\"": "",
  "What were you like before, when you still worshipped the Dark God?": "",
  "\"I was... a hunter, devout... to a fault. The tribute I gathered was... unrivalled. Many fell at my hands, in the name of a False God's... false cause. I don't expect to ever truly... repent, or forgive myself, but... should the False God be felled, and its madness put to an end... I believe I'll be able to rest easy. Until then...\" the Scarred smiles, \"...lead the way, kin.\"": "",
  "Favorite hobby?": "",
  "They blink once, and then again, before finally answering, \"It's... stargazing.\" The Scarred's gaze falls to the ground, and you get the feeling that they're... embarrassed? \"I... find it calming. That's... that's all I'll say on the matter. Now... if you'll excuse me, I... have some... very important meditating to attend to.\" You leave the room, almost content, but then you decide to tiptoe back and peek through the doorway... you catch a glimpse of the Scarred staring out the window before they turn, sending you fleeing through the hallway.": "",
  "No, just checking in.": "",
  "\"Very... well. Yes, I'm fine enough.\" That's all they say before closing their eye, effectively leaving the conversation.": "",
  "You're at the Scarred's door when you hear an intense crashing come from inside, causing you to rush in and find... the Scarred, standing over a pile of shattered glassware. \"Uh, kin! It's... not what it looks like!\" What exactly does it look like? You're not sure, but you feel uncomfortable with the entire scene and leave the room without saying a word...": "",
  "The Scarred's in the hold, rummaging through the food supply. Noticing your presence, they speak, \"Ah, kin. Have you... any idea where we keep the fish?\"": "",
  "The fish? Isn't that, like... cannibalism?": "",
  "They stop rummaging to turn and look at you, \"What's... that supposed to mean? Do I... look like a fish to you?\" You decide it's best to not answer, and guide them to the fish accordingly.": "",
  "The room's pitch black, but you get the feeling that the Scarred's in here meditating... it's less of a feeling, and more that you can hear their strange guttural chanting through the darkness. Best to not disturb them.": "",
  "You catch the Scarred in the hallway, drawing... on the wall. They're extremely crude, but they appear to be pictures of Deep Ones and their ships. The Scarred turns to you, \"Kin! I... hope you don't mind. I couldn't find any... paper, and I'm trying... to remember.\"": "",
  "Remember? Remember what?": "",
  "\"Remember... my past, and the people in it. Everything... before my meeting with the False God feels so... foggy. Still, bits and pieces return to me... every now and then. I don't wish to forget again, so I'm... recording them, through art.\" Remember... the word hangs oddly in your mind, but you can't figure out why. Regardless, you find the sentiment endearing and leave the Scarred to their drawing.": "",
  "You find the Hunger peeking into the Scarred's room, through the crack in the door. The airtight crack... regardless, they realize you've caught them and speak, \"CAPTAIN. Inq-q-q-q-uiry: Subjjject: TRAITOR. Request: Request: Request:\" It keeps repeating the word request, even as you give up and leave the room...": "",
  "The Scarred and the Hunger are relaxing together, you think... the Scarred speaks, \"You... speak strangely, even when compared to your kin. What exactly... has the False God done to you?\" The Hunger reverberates in place a bit, \"ABOVE. B-b-b-b-below? Subject-tcejbus: EVERYWHERE. State: State!: SCARRED.\" The Scarred seems troubled by this, but says nothing further. The two sit in silence, and you leave the room, unsure what to think...": "",
  "Vortigon is staring at the Scarred, as the latter sits deep in meditation. He looks to you and speaks, \"Why do they spend all day meditating if they've no God to pray to? What exactly are they accomplishing?\" You aren't sure yourself, you realize.": "",
  "Perhaps it has something to do with their power?": "",
  "He rolls his eyes, \"A power they've stolen from the very being they condemn! This one's hiding something. I don't know what it is, but should something happen... don't say nobody saw it coming! Until then, I suppose I'll have to trust the faith you place in them.\" Vortigon returns to his intrusive staring, and you return to your... whatever you were doing.": "",
  "The scene is tense... you find that Vortigon and the Scarred are sitting together, in uncomfortable silence. Eventually, the Scarred speaks, \"You... don't trust me. Tell me, priest... what know you of the False God?\" Vortigon gives a hearty laugh, \"Never heard of them! False indeed, but their power seems very real... a power you use willingly, for your own gain. Tell me, traitor... what know you of trust? Of faith, or devotion?\" The Scarred's face flares up with rage... it's a sort of anger you've never seen in them before.": "",
  "Interrupt.": "",
  "The Scarred's face calms, and they look to you, \"Kin! Fancy... meeting you here. On... your ship...\" Vortigon, silent, stares into the Scarred's good eye. You've defused the situation, but now it's really awkward... the Scarred coughs, \"I... guess I should be going. We can... continue this another time, Vortigon.\" They get up, and Vortigon replies, \"Yes, I believe we can. Until then...\" Vortigon closes his eyes and puts his hands together in prayer, \"...I've Gods to pray to.\"": "",
  "Slocknog and the Scarred appear to be bonding over a cigarette each, smoking together while they talk, \"It'sss ssso niccce to meet another exxxxile. Here I wasss thinking I wasss the only one dessspisssed by my own kind!\" The Scarred gives him a slight chuckle, \"I... do believe our situations have their great deal of... differences, monarch, but... I must agree, this is nice. Few... are so kind to me.\" The two continue to talk back and forth, and you leave the room with a smile on your face.": "",
  "It's not the Scarred you find, but Alkali, who rolls up to you distraught, \"Captain... thhhhat fiend, thhhhe Scarred, he refuses to call me by my name! Insists on calling me 'thhhhe Science-thhhhing!' Can you believe it? I know othhhher races are typically primitive but thhhhis is a new low.

  "The Hunger appears to be tearing into the floor in its room... they turn to you, \"CAPTAIN. Commmmmmplic-c-c-c-cation: HUNGER. Solution? Solution? Solution!: HURRY.\" Seems they want you to get this ship moving. Now.": "",
  "It's not hard to find them... you follow the scratches in the floor and eventually find the Hunger in the middle of a hallway, gyrating in place.": "",
  "Grab their attention.": "",
  "The Hunger's face turns to meet yours while the rest of their body continues to spin, \"PROTOCOL ERROR: PROTOCOL 'GREETING' CORRUPTED. ENFORCING BACKUP PROTOCOL: PROTOCOL FAREWELL. F-f-f-f-farewell, Captain? Captain! Bye-eyb, captain!\" With that, you watch as they crawl away, their face still locked with yours as they round the corner.": "",
  "Leave them to their strange ways.": "",
  "On second thought, you're not really in the mood to 'talk' to the Hunger... you leave them to their strange spinning.": "",
  "You find the Hunger in the hold tearing into the food supply. A shame, but, sooner the snacks than you, you suppose... probably best to leave them to their rampage regardless.": "",
  "After a bit of searching you catch the Hunger as it tears a chunk out of the wall. An expendable chunk, you're sure. This seems to satisfy them, and their face meets yours, \"Subject... subject?

  "Uh, hi. How are you, Hunger?": "",
  "\"HELLO t-t-to SUBJECT: You! You too, caaaaptain! Captain? Captain. R-r-repeating state: HUNGER is... is? Is! SATISFIED.\" A few moments pass, and then it jiggles slightly, \"STATE update? Update: HUNGER un-un-un... satisfied? Unsatisfied. SOLUTION: Devour! B-b-b-bye, captain...? Bye.\" They escape into the hole they've created in the wall, and you're left wondering just how much of this ship is expendable...": "",
  "You come across Turzil examining the Hunger, poking and prodding. You're about to speak when Turzil's arm is torn from his shoulder, engulfed by the Hunger as a reaction to his stimulus. Still, Turzil seems unphased.": "",
  "Is everything, uh... alright in here?": "",
  "Turzil turns to you, \"Does your sight -fail- you, captain? I fail to see what is 'alright' here.\" He turns back to the Hunger, \"This is no [mere] case of the Harmony connection eroding, and this is no [mere] Engi. These are -many- Engi, suffering. Held together, by [dark] forces. Forces I -fail- to understand.\" The Hunger wiggles around for a moment before speaking up, \"HUNGER: Dark! Dark, d-d-daaark... HARMONY: at bay? At bay! EROSION: Gone? Gone! PRICE: Deemed. Deemed, deemed, deemed! SUFFICIENT.\" Turzil rebukes, \"You've turned from one [cruel] master to another. You remain -trapped- like this: no more free than I, or any other Engi.\" He gives a robotic sigh, and turns to leave, \"One can only -hope- there's still a chance for them: somewhere. Good [luck] finding it, captain.\" You're left alone with the Hunger, who appears to have returned to nibbling on Turzil's arm.": "",
  "You enter the Hunger's room, but are surprised to find that it's Turzil standing there. He appears to be inspecting the room, and the damage it's suffered since the Hunger has moved in... of which there's a lot.": "",
  "Cough.": "",
  "Turzil seems startled, but only briefly, \"Captain. Inquiry: what do you -think- of the Disparity?\"": "",
  "What they're doing isn't right. The Engi under the Harmony don't deserve to suffer for its actions.": "",
  "\"To be [stripped] of your self would be described as suffering, by some. Following that logic, why would this -Hunger- sacrifice themselves? Become: many? Become: unthinking...\" he pauses, \"...perhaps in -losing- themselves, they sought to [save] many. A -daring- gambit. Results: remain to be seen. Part of me [prays] they remain that way. The -other- part... holds out [hope.] [Hope] that the Harmony can fall yet.\" Turzil leaves the room, and all is silent... save for the chewing sound coming from beneath the floorboards.": "",
  "I stand by them. The Engi deserve to be free from the Harmony, and the Separatists standing idle won't grant that.": "",
  "\"This: is true, regrettably. The problem, though, remains: this is a -war- against the Engi, for the Engi. Not to speak of their -dark- bargains. Should they win, will they truly be [free] to be themselves? [Free] from their shoes?\" You blink at that line, confused, and Turzil notices, \"Shackles. The word: is shackles. I'm still getting -used- to this [metaphor] thing.\" Embarrassed, he leaves the room, and all is silent... save for the chewing sound coming from beneath the floorboards.": "",
  "I'd rather not get involved.": "",
  "\"Your actions -betray- your words. Here I and this -Hunger- stand, [free] from the Harmony. Theory: you're merely humble, captain?\" You blush, and can't help but smile... you're kind of cool, you suppose. Satisfied, Turzil leaves the room, and all is silent... save for the chewing sound coming from beneath the floorboards.": "",
  "Leave him to it.": "",
  "You leave Turzil alone, and return to looking for the Hunger. You don't find them, but you do grow quite accustomed to the chewing sound coming from beneath the floorboards.": "",
  "On your way to the Hunger's room, you find them and OOJ in the middle of the hallway facing off... should you be concerned?": "",
  "You aren't really sure how to intervene, exactly, so you just kind of stand in-between them... they're both extremely close. You can hear OOJ's body pak-paking in place, and the Hunger as it nibbles upon the floorboards. Eventually, they both seem to back off... slowly. The Hunger never breaks eye contact with you, and OOJ never breaks OOJ-contact. Eventually, the paks and crunching sounds fade, and you're left alone...": "",
  "Observe.": "",
  "Nothing happens for a while, until OOJ begins vibrating... then, the Hunger reverberates in kind. You realize all hell is about to break loose as their vibrations pick up in pace to match the other's. OOJ's pak pak pak sounds accelerate faster and faster, as do the strange crunching noises the Hunger seems to be making... are you bearing witness to the creation of a particle accelerator? Can you even flee? Is anywhere within this ship safe? Is anywhere within this sector safe? This reality? This Multiverse? As you ponder these questions, both blobs spontaneously stop moving, completely defying their retention of momentum. OOJ slides one way, and the Hunger slides the other, until both are out of sight... what have you just witnessed?": "",
  "Despite your best efforts, you can't find the Hunger anywhere. You do hear a strange 'pak pak pak' sound coming from above the ceiling, mirrored in kind by a strange 'crunch crunch crunch' sound coming from beneath the floor... but it's probably nothing. Weird space tricks of the mind, and all that.": "",
  "The sound of crunching alerts you to the Hunger's location from across the ship, but you're surprised to find the Anointed there as well. They appear to be passing a large chunk of metal back and forth, taking turns eating it... the Hunger speaks, \"SUBJECT: An-n-n-n-noooointed? Anointed. State-etats-etats-etats: HUNGER? Hunger, too?\" to which the Anointed replies, \"Correct, strange Engi thing. We need not hunger alone, we need not decay alone. Together, we may devour all.\" The Hunger jiggles enthusiastically at this, and you leave the room concerned for your safety...": "",
  "As you approach the Foolish, his stance shrinks, \"Don't you have somebody worthhhhwhile you could be talking to...? Leave me alone...\" Dejected, he floats away, and you make a mental note to invest in some therapy lessons for your crew.": "",
  "Entering the Foolish's room, it appears to be empty... until you hear a thud above you. Looking up, you find that the Foolish is floating against the ceiling, slowly bumping into it and bouncing off over and over again. If he's aware of your presence, he isn't making it obvious.": "",
  "Hey, uh... you alright?": "",
  "He rotates to face you, still bumping against the ceiling, \"Yeah, I'm fine... Thhhhanks...\" Though he breaks eye contact, he doesn't turn back around.": "",
  "Somehow, I doubt that.": "",
  "The Foolish meets your gaze once more, his tone sterner, \"Really, I'm fine. I just... get thhhhis way, sometimes.\" He returns to being silent for a moment, and then sighs as he continues, \"Even if I wanted to cheer up, it's not exactly up to me. Thhhhings just... weigh heavily on my mind.\"": "",
  "What kinds of things? Anything I can help with?": "",
  "He seems to take a moment to gather his thoughts before answering, \"Not anymore thhhhan you already have, captain. It's just a mental battle withhhh myself...\" You notice as his attention is drawn to the floor, \"Thhhhough, if you could help me, uh... get down from here, I'd appreciate it.\" He outstretches his hand.": "",
  "Grab his hand and help him down.": "",
  "As you grab his hand, a sense of unease overwhelms your body, and you feel... nothing. As quick as it came, whatever the feeling was vanishes, and the Foolish looks at you expectantly, \"Captain? You alright?\"": "",
  "Yeah, I just... felt something. This is safe, right?": "",
  "For a moment, the Foolish just blinks, but then he pulls his hand away aggressively as concern coats his tone, \"Wait, what did you feel exactly?\"": "",
  "I... can't say I'm sure. I just felt wrong for a moment.": "",
  "He eases up a little, \"Well, thhhhe Soulplague isn't a thhhhreat, if thhhhat's your worry. It obeys me... as much as I loathhhhe thhhhe fact. My concern is thhhhe Dark God... it still holds some level of influence over me. If you felt somethhhhing, that probably means it's trying to pull somethhhhing, and I'm not allowing anybody else to endanger thhhhemselves for my sake.\" You watch as the Foolish takes a deep breath, before releasing it, as he slowly drifts back towards the floor. \"Thhhhank you for calming me down, at least. Sorry for my short-sightedness, thhhhough... I'd hate if I was used for anothhhher of the Dark God's schemes. I'll try to be more careful in the future.\" The Foolish floats out of the room, and you're left to wonder... what is the Dark God after, exactly?": "",
  "I... felt close. To each other.": "",
  "His body tilts a little, as if in confusion, \"Well... yeah? Meaning?\"": "",
  "We've never really gotten close before. I've always assumed it's unsafe.": "",
  "He seems to ponder this a moment before responding, \"Well, thhhhe Soulplague isn't a thhhhreat, if thhhhat's your worry. It obeys me... as much as I loathhhhe thhhhe fact.

  "Hesitate.": "",
  "A few moments pass as you stand there, staring at his hand. This appears to make the Foolish anxious, but he's yet to speak up.": "",
  "Is it safe for you to touch people?": "",
  "He thinks on it for a moment, before pulling his hand back, \"Well, thhhhe Soulplague isn't a thhhhreat, if thhhhat's your worry. It obeys me... as muchhhh as I loathhhhe thhhhe fact. Still, thhhhoughhhh, who knows what thhhhe Dark God might try to pull. It's probably for thhhhe best if I keep to myself.\" You watch as the Foolish takes a deep breath, before releasing it, as he slowly drifts back towards the floor. \"Thhhhank you for calming me down, at least. Sorry for my short-sightedness, thhhhough... I'd hate if I was used for anothhhher of the Dark God's schemes. I'll try to be more careful in the future.\" The Foolish floats out of the room, and you're left to wonder... what is the Dark God after, exactly?": "",
  "Shells have hands?": "",
  "He seems bewildered by your question, \"Yes? How else would we be doing thhhhings? You've seen us repair, at least, haven't you?\"": "",
  "Yeah, I just like... never really thought about it?": "",
  "The Foolish laughs, and your heart warms at the rare sight. \"Well, yes, we have hands.\" He pulls his hand back, before taking a deep breath and releasing it. Slowly, his body drifts back towards the floor, \"Thhhhank you for cheering me up, captain... you're silly.\" He pauses, before getting flustered, \"In a good way, thhhhough!\" The Foolish hurries to float out of the room, and you get the feeling that he's blushing within his shell.": "",
  "You... have cute hands.": "",
  "The Foolish is utterly taken aback by this as he struggles to stutter out a response, \"I- My- What? My hands? You... Do you really... I...\" his breathing quickens, and you notice as his body begins to drift back towards the floor on its own, \"...I, uh, have to go, captain! Thhhhank you for, um, cheering me up!\" He rushes to float out of the room, bumping into several things on the way, and you can't help but think... he really is cute.": "",
  "Well, alright... I won't pry.": "",
  "Though his words aren't exactly convincing, you're not in the business of pushing your crew to open up. The Foolish thanks you for understanding, and you leave him to his... floating against the ceiling.": "",
  "As you approach the Foolish's room, you notice strange, iridescent lights shimmering from within the cracks in his door... What in the Multiverse is going on in there?": "",
  "That's probably normal. Enter the room.": "",
  "Pressing your hand against the door, pain shoots through your arm as you find yourself launched back several feet. Your body crashes into the wall with immense force, and you spend a few moments lying on the ground in a daze before clamoring to stand back up. Struggling to stand, you decide that it's probably best to come back later...": "",
  "Yeah, no, screw that. I'm not getting involved with any weird alien business today.": "",
  "Whatever the hell's going on in there, you're not interested in finding out. Cautiously, you back away from the door, and it merely continues to glisten in response.": "",
  "It takes you a moment, but you find the Foolish rummaging through a container in the hold. Sensing your presence, he turns to face you, \"Oh, uh, hello... Was thhhhere somethhhhing you needed?\" He seems nervous, but you figure he always is.": "",
  "I wanted to see you! What're you doing in here?": "",
  "He appears to be shocked by that, fidgeting a bit before answering, \"I was just, um, a bit hungry... As a mattervirus, thhhhe Soulplague typically lets me get away withhhh eating just about anythhhhing, but... sometimes it craves somethhhhing in particular.\"": "",
  "Something in particular? Like?": "",
  "\"Like... well... cardboard...\" The Foolish averts his gaze and sinks a little from where he typically floats in the air, bumping against the floor. \"You don't, uh... happen to know where we might keep some, do you, captain?\"": "",
  "I can't say I do.": "",
  "Pressing against the floor harder, he replies, dejected, \"Thhhhat's okay, it was a stupid craving anyways... Thhhhanks for wanting to talk to me, at least. See you around, captain...\" The Foolish closes the container he'd been rummaging through, and, as opposed to rolling or floating, scrapes his body against the floor as he inches his way out of the room.": "",
  "Oh, I was just passing by.": "",
  "This appears to relieve him a bit, as his tone lightens, \"Oh, alright. We'll, uh, talk later thhhhen, captain. See you around... maybe...\" The Foolish continues to stare at you until you leave the hold, where you then hear him return to his rummaging. You can only wonder what he's searching for...": "",
  "You find the Foolish messing about with his shell, making measurements and taking samples. He seems deep in thought, and doesn't comment on your approach, so you figure it's best to come back another time. As you leave the room, you hear him mumble to himself, \"Is thhhhis... cyan or turquoise? Last week it was cyan, but... now it feels hard to tell...\" Isn't it always?": "",
  "Alkali appears to be experimenting on the Foolish, who only sits there dejectedly. The former speaks, still poking and prodding, \"You know, when I heard thhhhat communication had been lost with Epsilon, I'd figured you guys had just managed to blow yourselves up or somethhhhing. Never could I have imagined thhhhe truthhhh of the matter! Tell me, what was it like?\" The Foolish turns away, before Alkali turns him back, and he sighs a little, \"What was what like? Thhhhe cold? Thhhhe... voices? Thhhhe... genocide...?\" Alkali scoffs, \"No, nothhhhing so trivial, obviously. I meant approaching my genius! Thhhhis Soulplague stuff is impressive! Relative to thhhhose less impressive thhhhan me, of course.\"": "",
  "You feel the room physically heat up, ever so slightly, as contempt literally radiates from the Foolish. He glares at Alkali, \"Do you thhhhink our colleagues found it impressive, as it ravaged thhhheir minds and puppeted thhhheir bodies? Do you thhhhink you'd find it impressive, if you... met thhhhe same fate?\" Alkali briefly pauses whatever test he's conducting, taken aback slightly. Then, he continues, \"Well, I don't have to worry about thhhhat, do I? Not as long as you control it, anyways. You, er, do control it, don't you?\" The Foolish relaxes a bit, returning to his usual demeanor, \"As much as I can, anyways... It's not a thhhhreat, if thhhhat's what you mean. Still... rogue strains of thhhhe mattervirus are out thhhhere, hurting people...\" He slouches, and Alkali slaps him on the back, \"All thhhhe more reason to sit still and allow me to perform my tests! If anybody can cure thhhhis virus, it's me!\" Seemingly in agreement, the Foolish only sighs again, and the two Shells go quiet. You decide to leave them to their experiments.": "",
  "Though you can't find the Foolish, you do find Alkali, who appears to be looking for him himself. He turns to you, \"Say, Renegade, you haven't seen thhhhat botched experiment, have you? Thhhhe Epsilon reject, I mean.\"": "",
  "You mean the Foolish?": "",
  "Alkali chuckles, \"I'm glad we're on thhhhe same page, thhhough 'foolish' isn't exactly how I'd put it. I'd choose a stronger title, like, 'Thhhhe Completely Irredeemable Dumbass' or somethhhhing. Anyways, have you seen him?\" He's as charming as always...": "",
  "Right... well, no, I haven't. I'm looking for him myself.": "",
  "He sighs and begins to roll away, \"Figured you'd be useless. Well, if you do see him, let him know thhhhat mattervirus of his transmogrified my toothhhbrush into a sentient globule of matter-devouring hatred again. Please remind him to refrain from using my toothhhbrush, before I turn his into a makeshift explosive.\" Alkali turns the corner, and you're only left wondering... do Shells really have teeth?": "",
  "Tully and the Foolish are locked in a heated game of chess, Tully seeming to be way more into it than the Foolish is. You can't really track the match, but Tully moves a piece and seems proud of himself, \"You know, I don't get a lot of time to play it anymore, but back in the day I was a natural at this stuff! It's nice to relax and go back to those times, even if only for a moment.\" The Foolish fidgets around with a piece, before making a move himself, \"Thhhhings really were a lot simpler in thhhhe past... Never really was into chess, thhhough. Still, I'm having fun, I thhhhink...\" Tully moves a piece, and the Foolish doesn't hesitate to move his in response, \"Thhhhat's checkmate, right...?\" Scanning the board, Tully laughs, \"So it is! Gah, it seems I've lost my touch! You'll let me take another crack at it sometime, won't you?\" Seemingly in better spirits, the Foolish replies amidst cleaning up the board, \"Sure, I had fun. Thhhhanks, Tully...\" You're glad to see that even the pessimists among your crew have their spirits high as the two leave the room, content.": "",
  "You walk in on the Foolish as the Scarred inspects his body, the iridescence of his skin seeming to recoil at the latter's touch. The Foolish turns to them, hesitance in his voice, \"I've... never seen thhhhe mattervirus react to someone's touch like this. Who exactly ARE you?\" The Scarred sighs, backing away slightly, \"I wish... I could answer that myself. The False God... took my name, as it took yours. Both of our powers are... of its making, and yet... they seem to antagonize one another. For... what purpose?\" The two sit in silence for a while, deep in thought, and you decide its best to leave them to their pondering.": "",
  "Walking through the hall, you're stopped in your tracks as you're surprised to see the Foolish standing there, yelling out to you, \"CAPTAIN!!! Whatever you do, don't move!\"": "",
  "What? What is it?": "",
  "He cuts you off mid-sentence, \"SSSHHHHHH! Listen! Somethhhhing's HERE, in the ship!\" Indeed, you try your best to listen. Beneath the humming of the ship's many functions is an almost inaudible sound; a distant crunch, crunch, crunch... you could recognize that noise anywhere!": "",
  "Oh, that's just the Hunger. Nothing to worry about.": "",
  "The Foolish is taken aback, \"Nothhhhing to- Thhhhat THHHHING is eating thhhhrough the ship's hull? And... you're sure thhhhat's safe?\" You nod, and he begins to float away in confusion, \"I guess we all have our peculiarities, one way or anothhhher... Look at me talking, like I'm any less potentially life-thhhhreatening...\" The Foolish turns the corner, further ruminating on its own self-worth, and you're left alone with that familiar crunching noise.": "",
  "A spear flies right past your head, whizzing through the air behind you before digging itself several feet into the wall with a resounding THUD. The Heroine calls out, \"Hold STILL already! This will be QUICK, if you just STOP!!! RUNNING!!!\" She appears to be chasing around one of the Foolish's Soulplague Husks... not wanting to get caught in the crossfire of her righteous wrath, you choose to simply turn the other way before one of those hull-shattering spears makes you its next victim.": "",
  "Tinkering with his armor, the Minister puts up his free hand as you approach, \"Sorry, Renegade. Busy right now. The armor's core is acting up again, and I've got to get it stable before it tears a hole in the fabric of spacetime and rips this ship apart.\" Yeah, that, uh... sounds important. You'll try again later.": "",
  "As you're looking for the Minister, the power to the ship briefly flickers off. A few moments later, it happens again, and you hear the man you're looking for cry out, \"Why are you being greedy NOW? How much of this do you want, exactly?\"": "",
  "Rush to his side.": "",
  "You follow the sound of his voice, and he turns to face you as the power returns once more, \"Oh, Renegade. Sorry about the, er, instability of the ship's systems. Armor's hungry.\" He doesn't elaborate before returning to whatever it is that he was doing, and you notice the cables flowing from his suit... drawing power directly from the ship's reactor.": "",
  "Is that safe?": "",
  "He turns to you again, making no effort to hide his annoyance, \"Yes? Would I be doing it if it wasn't? Like I said, the armor's hungry, and I hardly think you'd prefer the alternative solutions.\" He tinkers with one of the cables, before shooting one more glare back at you, \"It's fine, Renegade. I won't blow up the ship, or otherwise do whatever it is that you're worried about. You can run along now; I must see to it that this is sorted before our next scuffle.\" His condescending demeanor aside, you feel confident that you can trust him as you leave the room and move to wander the halls. As you do so, the power flickers off and on again, and that confidence begins to wane ever so slightly.": "",
  "He sounds like he's having a rough time, and you know he hardly likes to be bothered. Leaving him alone, you move to wander the ship's halls, confident that whatever he's doing is probably fine. The lights continue to flicker, off and on, then off and on again, and that confidence begins to wane ever so slightly.": "",
  "Searching for the Minister, you find that he's in the break room, sipping coffee. You don't recall this ship having a coffee machine...": "",
  "Where'd you get that?": "",
  "He tilts his head to the side as he takes another sip, signaling for you to look over, and you move to do so... If YOU had coffee in your mouth, you'd be spitting it out at the sight of the mess across the room. An unholy contraption lay devastated atop the counter, the loose coffee beans laying around remaining as the only hint towards its purpose. The space around it is scorched, and what remains of the machine itself is utterly warped and shredded.": "",
  "You... made an impromptu explosive, and used it to make coffee?": "",
  "He puts his cup down, and smirks, \"That's one way to put it, yes. Genius, no?\"": "",
  "But, where did you get the coffee beans?": "",
  "Another head tilt, this time to the opposite side of the room, draws your gaze once more. You stare at the monstrosity there for a moment, half horrible-slime-creature, half coffee-plant-thing, before moving to pick up the Minister's coffee. He doesn't object as you do so, and you take a long, hard sip.": "",
  "Spit the coffee out everywhere.": "",
  "You can't think of a reponse more appropriate. The Minister seems amused, more than anything, as you put his cup back down and turn to leave the room, neither of you speaking another word of the horrors he's born here.": "",
  "Though it isn't hard to find him, you don't get much of a word in before the Minister shoos you out of his room with a list of things he needs you to grab... for his experiments, allegedly, though it reads more like a grocery list. Doesn't he have underlings that can handle this?": "",
  "Read the list.": "",
  "Inked upon a piece of lined paper is the Minister's list:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tEg g\n\t\t\tEgg\n\t\t\tSugar\n\t\t\t-----flour\n\t\t\tInordinate-spacetime matter-stabilizing device (turquoise)\n\t\t\tegg": "",
  "Okay, sure. Get the Minister the things he's asked for.": "",
  "The cooking ingredients aren't so hard to scrounge around for, but the space and time thingy seems a bit... exotic. The best you can find is cyan food coloring, and you decide to leave his requests outside his door, lest he asks you to explain yourself. Later that day, you hear yelling from his room, \"No, no! I said turquoise! TURQUOISE!\" Is the difference really that important?": "",
  "What am I? His mother? Crumple the list into a ball and throw it away.": "",
  "Tossing the piece of paper aside, a flash of light bursts forth from it; by the time your vision recovers, you feel even more blinded by what you're seeing... in the crumpled paper's place are all the things that were listed on it. Not really wanting to question it, and certainly not wanting to approach the mysterious, reverberating device that you can only assume is the space and time thingy, you leave the collection of items outside the Minister's door. Later that day, you hear yelling from his room, \"No, no! I said turquoise! TURQUOISE!\" You thought it was...": "",
  "You find the Minister in his room, kneeling down on the floor and inspecting a photograph. If he's noticed your presence, he's yet to make it obvious.": "",
  "He sighs, and turns to you, \"Yes, I'm aware you're here. I'd have to be deaf not to be... Is there truly something so important that you deem it necessary to interrupt my ruminations?\"": "",
  "Your... ruminations? What's on your mind exactly?": "",
  "The Minister looks you over, as if measuring whether or not you're worth talking to, before sighing again and looking back at the photo in his hands, \"It's... my daughter. She rarely leaves my mind. I've already told you enough on the matter, but... there's something about it I'd like to ask you.\"": "",
  "Me? I can try to answer, but I'm not sure what I can offer you.": "",
  "He nods, \"An answer is all I seek.\" The Minister then stares you straight in the eyes, a sense of hollowness behind his own, \"Do you believe everything you've seen? Everything you've been told?\"": "",
  "That's... a vague question.": "",
  "\"Everything about our situations, and our relationship, is vague. Yet, we must trust our own judgments on such matters nonetheless.\" He blinks, for the first time during this conversation, \"So, tell me. Do you trust in what you've been told? About the Rebellion, or the Tempest, or... anything, really. To put it simply: do you trust in the authenticity of our reality?\"": "",
  "It's common to entertain notions of simulated realities, or of coma-induced dream states, but you get the sense that the Minister is referring to something else entirely. Something darker, and more sinister. Yet, he seems satisfied with your answer as he turns to the photo in his hands once more, \"Very well, Renegade. That will be all.\"": "",
  "Wait, really? You're going to drop a question as ominous as that and then refuse to elaborate?": "",
  "He chuckles slightly, \"You're easily spooked, aren't you? It's just something that's been on my mind, lately, as I continue down this path set before me. Despite my genius, and the power this damnable armor grants me, I feel no greater than a pawn as I blindly follow the orders given to me. As I exist in this state of limbo, ever in search of an outcome that may very well never come to pass. I... felt we were similar in that regard.\" He lets out a deep sigh, \"Perhaps I misjudged. Or maybe I'm just too damn gloomy for my own good. Whatever the case, I suspect I won't get to the bottom of it standing here and discussing it with you. Minimal offense meant, of course.\" Right... taking the hint, you leave the Minister to his eerie ponderings, but a part of them leave the room with you. What is it that he's doubtful of, exactly?": "",
  "Yes?": "",
  "Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes": "",
  "He seems busy, you decide. You quietly make an exit, the Minister never once stirring, and you're left to wonder what's weighing so heavily on his mind.": "",
  "A strange chanting can be heard from within the Minister's room as you near his door, its hymns seeming to worm their way into your mind. Immeasurable amounts of unease wash over you as you question your decision to enter.": "",
  "Steel yourself, and enter.": "",
  "You press yourself against the door, ready for any of the possible scenarios your mind can think of... but not for the one in front of you. The Minister, as well as several other cloaked cultists of the Tempest, sit around a rounded coffee table; you gather that they're playing a board game of some sort. Across the room is a radio, blasting the chanting you'd heard prior. The Minister turns to you, trying his best to yell over its immense volume, \"RENEGADE? HAVE YOU SOME REASON FOR INTERRUPTING OUR PROCEEDINGS?\"": "",
  "I, uh... thought you were opening portals to other dimensions in here, or something.": "",
  "He squints at you, \"SORRY? I CAN'T QUITE- HOLD ON FOR A MOMENT.\" The Minister stands up and walks over to the radio, turning it off with a spark of energy from his gauntlet, and the room goes deafeningly quiet. He turns to you once more, \"Well, whatever your reason for interrupting, we were just about done here anyways. Next Tuesday, gentlemen?\" A series of consenting murmurs break out from the gathered cultists, and they all vanish in a blinding flash of light.": "",
  "What was that about?": "",
  "The Minister raises an eyebrow, gesturing to the game laid out on the table, \"Hm? Are you truly unfamiliar with Khl'gthkk'xri?\" You blink a couple times, and he sighs, \"I should expect as much. It's not exactly renowned, but I wouldn't have been surprised if you'd heard of it either. It's something of a... cult classic.\" He stares at you, completely stone-faced, and you have no idea if he's expecting you to laugh or not.": "",
  "Force a laugh.": "",
  "His eyebrow arches even higher, \"Did... I say something funny? Are you quite alright, Renegade? Did you hit your head on the way in?\"": "",
  "You two spend a few moments staring at each other, both at a loss for words. Eventually, it's your will that breaks first, as you awkwardly excuse yourself and slip away into the hall. That, uh... sucked. A lot. Of all the questions that have gone unanswered, one rings throughout your mind above all... who convenes on a Tuesday?": "",
  "You stand there, speechless, and his eyebrow arches even higher, \"Are... you quite alright, Renegade? Did you hit your head on the way in?\"": "",
  "You two spend a few moments staring at each other, the Minister joining you in speechlessness. Eventually, it's your will that breaks first, as you awkwardly excuse yourself and slip away into the hall. That, uh... sucked. A lot. Of all the questions that have gone unanswered, one rings throughout your mind above all... who convenes on a Tuesday?": "",
  "Nope. Walk away.": "",
  "Whatever the hell is going on in there is none of your business, and you're not trying to get caught in the crossfire of any of the Minister's eldritch rituals. Though you get quite some distance away, you can still hear that droning chanting... it's as if it follows you, everywhere you go. You shrug, and decide that it's just par for the course in housing the leader of an esoteric cult.": "",
  "A white blur whizzes past you, and the Minister comes running soon after, \"Make way, make way! One of the Tempest's spawn has broken containment!\" He turns the corner, and an explosion blasts from it mere seconds later... you need to take cover!": "",
  "Drop to the floor, and cover your head!": "",
  "You assume a defensive position, and close your eyes, but... nothing happens. You look up, and are surprised to see the Minister return, the boots of his armor dragging against the ground. He shoots you a glance, \"The problem child's been dealt with. My sincerest apologies for the disturbance, Renegade. It won't happen again.\" There's a tinge of scorn in his voice as he walks past you, and you're left alone, lying on the floor.": "",
  "You come across Vortigon and the Minister, deep in conversation, as the former speaks, \"So... this, eh, Tempest that you worship. You claim it to have dominion over the Holy Ones?\" He says the name Tempest as if it'd stolen his lunch money. The Minister puts a hand to his chin, ignoring the slight, \"There are Crystals among the Cult of the Tempest's ranks, yes. Why do you ask? Are you looking to switch religions?\" Vortigon lets out a deep belly laugh, \"I can't say so, but, you've confirmed a suspicion of mine. This Tempest of yours must be none other than a Holy one, holier than any other! To think such a thing possible... I'll have to consult the scriptures...\" He walks away, lost in thought, and the Minister notices your presence as he shoots you a puzzled look. You shrug.": "",
  "Though you don't find the Minister, you do find Jerry walking through the halls. His eyes are wide, as if he'd seen a ghost, and he doesn't so much as look at you as he slowly shambles by. You know he's a bit of an awkward fellow, but... this is weird, even for him.": "",
  "Try to grab his attention.": "",
  "You call his name, and Jerry stops in his tracks, making the slowest turn in human history towards you. Eventually, he's facing you, as he struggles to stammer something out, \"C-c-c-captain... That... t-that... THING, in the b-b-bathroom... is it r-real? REALLY real?\"": "",
  "Thing? What thing?": "",
  "Jerry takes a few minutes to describe the horror plaguing him: some sort of tentacled fiend, eyeing him from the darkness. From his description, you gather that it's just one of the Tempest's spawn, likely let loose by the Minister for some unknowable purpose. You could tell Jerry as much, of course, but...": "",
  "Tell him the truth, and comfort him.": "",
  "You explain the nature of the Tempest's spawn to the best of your limited ability, and Jerry blinks a few times. \"So... it's alright then?\" You nod, and he breathes a comically large sigh of relief, \"Okay, thank goodness! I'll try not to stare the next time it, uh... stares, then. To think that uncle would hire men with interests in such odd company!\" Jerry walks away, the life returning to his stride, and you feel the teeniest bit of warmth within your heart.": "",
  "Come up with a lie, and mess with him.": "",
  "You put a hand to your chin, feigning deep thought, and you tell Jerry he might've been contacted by something otherworldly. His jaw drops, and he stares at you for a moment before his eyes roll back in his head, and his body drops to the floor; Jerry has passed out. He's... really that easy to scare, huh? Feeling slightly bad, you get him a blanket and ask someone to watch over him and make sure nobody trips on him in the hall.": "",
  "Leave the poor boy be.": "",
  "Something's clearly disturbed him, but you figure it's best to leave Jerry alone. Besides, what if he's just sleepwalking? You'd hate to ruin whatever wondrous dreams he's having in that, uh, Jerry head of his.": "",
  "Turning a corner, you find Haynes interrogating the Minister, the latter hardly entertained by the matter as he tinkers away at something.\n\t\n\t\"Profession?\"\n\t\n\t\"Minister.\"\n\t\n\t\"Allegiance?\"\n\t\n\t\"The Tempest.\"\n\t\n\t\"Family?\"\n\t\n\t\"Missing.\"\n\t\n\t\"Date of birth?\"\n\t\n\t\"Irrelevant.\"\n\t\n\tHaynes seems stumped by that last one, \"How are we going to fill out the form, then? Are you taking this pizza order as seriously as I am?\"": "",
  "Pizza order...?": "",
  "The Minister snaps his attention to the detective, clearly fed up, \"And why in the Tempest's name do they need to know any of that in order to deliver us a pepperoni pizza? Are they delivering it via interdimensional wormhole?\" Haynes crosses his arms, \"How should I know? I'm just trying to fill the bloody thing out.\" To which the Minister raises his voice, \"You're the GREAT detective, are you not? Isn't it your job to know?\" Said detective takes a step forward, raising his own voice, \"Well, aren't you THE Minister? Can't you just ask this 'The Tempest' of yours for a pizza?\" This causes the Minister to slam his fist down, \"You should know such frivolities to be below its concerns! Or are you as dense as everyone else here?\" The two continue to go back and forth for a while, getting progressively heated, and you get the sneaking suspicion that you won't be receiving any pizza deliveries.": "",
  "While the two aren't necessarily hostile to one another, there's an undeniable tension in the room whenever both the Scarred and the Minister are present. You find the two in the cafeteria, sitting opposite each other. Neither is speaking a word as they both stare off into space. Though you decide it would be awkward here to confront them here, in front of everybody, a part of you would really like to ask the two to just relax and ease up a bit; our enemies are the Rebels, not each other! Right?": "",
  "A loud, crunching noise draws your attention, and you find the Minister feeding bits of metal to the Hunger as if it were a pet. Eventually, the latter seems to get a bit rowdy, and it attempts to nibble at the Minister's armor. As it does so, its blobby body is sent flying, and its screams pierce your ears, \"I-I-I-INEDIBLE. FAMILIAR? Liberator? H-h-how...? How!\" The Minister lets out a chuckle in response, as he tosses one last scrap of metal towards the reeling Engi, \"How interesting... I'll be keeping an eye on you, spawn. Do be careful around the armor, yes?\" He walks away, amused with himself, and the Hunger jiggles its way towards you, \"Captain... C-c-c-captain... INQUIRY: What? Why! WHO IS HE. E-e-exactly...?\" You wish you were sure yourself.": "",
  "You're walking to the Minister's room as an armored hand tightly grasps your shoulder, and you're aggressively turned around to face its owner. To your surprise, though, it's not the Minister standing there, but... the Heroine. Though it's hard to get a read on her through her helmet, you feel a level of intensity in her stare uncommon for even her.": "",
  "Are you alright? What's the matter?": "",
  "The Heroine's grip around your shoulder tightens a little as she leans in, \"You trust me, right? You stood with me against evil before, simply because I asked you to. Simply because I said it was what was right, and you trusted that.\"": "",
  "I mean, yes, but... what's this about?": "",
  "Her voice quivers a bit, uncharacteristically, \"I... believe we have welcomed yet another evil onto our very ship. This Minister of yours, and the spawn of this Tempest... they... REEK. Of evil, of deceit, and of ILL INTENTIONS. My spear burns hot in their presence, and I'm of sure of this as it is. However...\" She stares off to the side for a moment, before locking eyes again, \"He is here as your ally, as I am, and I trust your judgment... as you trust mine. So, I ask you this, comrade: do you truly believe in this Minister?\"": "",
  "Yes, I do. I trust him as much as I'd trust you.": "",
  "She relaxes, and simply nods her head before walking away. Let's hope you can trust in your own decisions as much as she does.": "",
  "I... can't say I do. I share your same concerns.": "",
  "The Heroine tightens her grip once more, now practically crushing your shoulder with her fervor, \"Then let us do what heroes do BEST. A NEW EVIL DIES TONIGHT, COMRADE! STAND WITH ME AS WE MARCH AGAINST THE SHORES OF ITS DARK STRONGHOLD, AND DESTROY THIS CORRUPTION THAT BLIGHTS US. FOR THE MULTIVERSE!!!\" Her spear in hand, she sprints in the general direction of the Minister's room, and you have little choice but to follow her.": "",
  "Run after her.": "",
  "It's not easy, but you manage to keep up with her zealous march. You're right behind the Heroine as she crashes through the door to the Minister's room, yelling out, \"SHOW YOURSELF, EVIL, FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS INEVITABLE! YOUR DEFENSES HAVE FAILED YOU, AND JUSTICE KNOCKS AT YOUR DOOR!!\" The Minister sits up in his chair, completely bewildered, \"The door you've just DEMOLISHED? What in the hell is the meaning of this?\" He looks past the Heroine, and towards you, \"Renegade? May I suggest you keep this brute on a leash if she's out and about, destroying things as she pleases?\" Shes brandishes her spear at him, and his stature tenses, \"Or, are you with her? Is this your idea of camaraderie?\"": "",
  "The Heroine interrupts you before you can really get a word in, \"SILENCE, SNAKE, BEFORE I CUT OFF YOUR SILVERED TONGUE.\" Her grip around her spear tightens, and you realize you can hear it searing within her hands as it's pointed towards the Minister's armor. She speaks, \"THIS... ARMOR OF YOURS, FIEND. I CAN SENSE ITS MALICE. ITS HATRED FOR LIFE, AND ALL WHO DEFEND IT. FOR WHAT REASON DO YOU DON THIS EVIL?\" The Minister rolls his eyes, immediately tired of the theatrics, \"Am I to be silent, or are you here to question me?\" A spear narrowly whizzes past his head, and the Heroine takes a step forward, \"THE NEXT ONE WILL NOT MISS. SPEAK.\" The annoyance previously present on the Minister's face has been all but replaced with an emotion you can't say you've never seen him express before: fear.": "",
  "Isn't this a bit much?": "",
  "This time, your words reach her, and her intensity lowers slightly, \"Forgive me, comrade, but this is a serious matter. This armor of his isn't just evil, it's MADE of evil. A physical evil akin to that dreaded mattervirus, if not even greater... so, again, I ask you, fiend. For what reason do you wear it?\" The Minister answers quickly, panic overtaking his voice, \"Are you people MAD? I've explained all I know of the armor, and its purpose. It isn't fucking evil, it is ARMOR! CLOTHING! Impossibly resilient and unspeakably dangerous clothing, sure, but it doesn't INTEND anything. It is an object that I am bound to- to my own dismay, may I add, and it does as I instruct it to. For the most part, anyways, as is the case with any unstable machine...\" A sadness coats his voice as his words drift off, but the Heroine hardly seems to care, \"If this THING of evil truly holds you against your will, then you should have no qualm with me destroying it.\"": "",
  "Can you really destroy it?": "",
  "\"There is no evil in this Multiverse that I CAN'T destroy. Such is my vow...\" You look to the Minister, and to your surprise, he looks as if he's considering the possibility. After a moment of doing so, he speaks, \"You are extraordinary yourself, sure, but this armor is indestructible. I was promised as much as it forced itself onto me, and... trust me, I've tried.\" He sighs for a moment, before continuing, \"I'm not opposed to having it removed, if that will absolve me in your eyes, but I fear for the potential consequences. The armor hasn't taken kindly to my attempts to remove it in the past.\" The Heroine takes his words to heart, and she lowers her spear as she turns to you, \"I... believe him, comrade. Even still... while he may not be evil, that armor is. I would attempt to remove it, if you would allow.\" You look to the Minister, and he seems to be in agreement. It's your call.": "",
  "We came here to vanquish evil. Let's see this through.": "",
  "The Heroine nods, and turns to the Minister, \"Take a moment to brace yourself. I will be driving my spear through the armor's core, the source of its evil, and attempting to shatter its hold over you from there. Let me know when you are ready.\" The Minister nods in turn, and takes a moment to gather himself. You watch as he turns his hands over, observing his gauntlets and clenching them into a fist. Should the Heroine succeed here... he will be free not only from the armor, but maybe even the Tempest. He could search for his daughter, earnestly, and leave the horrors of his cult-life behind him. With you, the Heroine, and... everyone. He would truly be free, and you feel that he knows it as much as you do. With a deep breath, he closes his eyes and puffs his chest out, \"Alright. I'm ready. Give it your best shot, hero.\"": "",
  "Raising her spear at the armor once more, the Heroine cries out, \"INANIMATE YOU MAY BE, CAGE, YOU ARE NO LESS EVIL FOR IT. I WILL CRUSH YOU, AND, ONE DAY, TOO WILL I CRUSH YOUR MALEVOLENT MASTER. OF THIS, I PROMISE.\" She assumes a stance, ready to strike, \"Now... FALL, CAGE! BREAK. UNDER THE WEIGHT OF YOUR SINS, AND UNDER THE FORCE OF MY WILL!!\" The Heroine rushes forward with supernatural speed, and her spear meets the Minister's armor with a thunderous CRACK. Thin tendrils of light begin to spill forth from its core... and you realize she's managed to penetrate it, if only slightly. With a roar, she thrusts again, and again, and again; manifestations of her will empowering her as she does so. A cacophony of colors rushes forth from her spear as she makes one final, decisive strike, and...": "",
  "Your vision is overtaken as the core's light becomes blinding, and the only sense you can rely on becomes your hearing. You hear the Heroine as she cries out, the Minister as he recoils under the weight of her blow, and... a third thing within the chaos. A droning noise, beneath everything else. Before you can really pinpoint it, though, the Minister screams out, \"STOP! The suit, it's-\" He stops speaking for a moment, before wincing in pain as horror overtakes his voice, \"-I FEEL IT! IT'S- AACK... IT'S TEARING ME APART!!! IT'S KILLING ME- STOP!! PLEASE-\" The Heroine responds in kind, panic in her own voice, \"I... I don't know what this is! My spear is stuck fast... Have we made a mistake...?\"": "",
  "What can I do...?": "",
  "The Minister's screams intensify as he begs for help, for forgiveness... for his daughter. The Heroine desperately tries to help, but there's nothing to be done. The only thing louder than the Minister's screams are the silence that follows, and... that noise. It's stronger now, overpowering the Heroine's own desperate cries. The light in the room grows in strength, brighter than merely blinding, and you do your best to shield your eyes. By the time you open them again, the light is gone, but... so is the Minister. In the Heroine's arms is his armor, now empty. You notice her spear still embedded in its core, but... whatever damage it had done appears to have been undone somehow, as you realize the core's exterior has closed around the spear itself.": "",
  "No trace of the Minister remains in your systems... what exactly happened to him...?": "",
  "What... did you do...?": "",
  "You can hear her crying as she answers you, \"I... I don't... I'm sorry... I didn't think-\" Before she can finish her sentence, that humming from before strikes you as it continues to grow louder, and louder. It's... the armor. Is it going to explode? You call out to her again, this time to tell her to drop the armor and run, but... it's too late. As she turns to face you, the armor releases another flash of light from within her arms, and you're forced to guard your eyes once more. By the time your vision recovers... the Heroine, too, is gone. This time, not even her armor remains. Only the Minister's, and... her spear, still stuck fast within its core. The armor crashes to the ground, and you're left utterly alone in the wake of its light.": "",
  "The Heroine, too, leaves no trace. Damn it all...": "",
  "Scream out for your friends.": "",
  "You're not sure what else to do. What else you CAN do. As you're crying out, releasing your anguish, a movement in the room catches your attention. The armor just moved.": "",
  "What...?": "",
  "For a moment you think you must've just imagined it, but then it happens again. The armor's fingers begin to twitch, and then its legs, and then it in its entirety. It spasms, and jerks, its movements growing more and more intense, before... it locks in place, arms and legs straight, and begins to float.": "",
  "Have I lost my mind?": "",
  "The armor faces you in a way that feels intentional. Its gauntlet reaches over, grasping the spear within its chest, and it simply... removes it. Its core heals over as it does so, and it looks as if it'd never been pierced at all. It drops the spear to the ground, and continues to face you.": "",
  "What are you? What have you done with my friends?": "",
  "Its core dims, then flashes, and then REALLY flashes as the room goes white once more. This time... it's the armor that vanishes, but not without a trace. Inspecting your ship's systems, it seems to have left a piece of data for you to find... a set of coordinates. Your mind screams that it must be some sort of trap, but your heart aches for your missing friends. If there's any chance that they're at these coordinates, or that you can avenge them there, you'd like to take it.": "",
  "Don't worry... I'm coming.": "",
  "I don't think this is worth the risk. We should figure out another way.": "",
  "The two begrudgingly agree, and the situation settles down. If the Minister is lastingly upset about the attempt on his life, he doesn't make it apparent, but... you still feel awkward about the whole thing. As well, what the Heroine said about the Minister's armor continues to ring throughout your head. Can it truly be a being made of pure hatred?": "",
  "You try to grab her attention, but the Heroine seems to be preoccupied with chasing a rat around the ship. Though she doesn't pay you any mind, she does yell after the rodent as it outspeeds her, \"YOU MAY RUN, VILE VERMIN, BUT KNOW THIS. JUSTICE. NEVER! TIRES!! YOUR INFECTIOUS REIGN OF TERRORS ENDS HERE!!!\" At least she's having fun.": "",
  "Searching for the Heroine, a loud noise grabs your attention... it sounds like glass being shattered. Following the sound, you're drawn to the cafeteria, where, sure enough, the Heroine appears to be smashing dishes against the ground. She yells out as she does so, \"BE FREE, GLASS-KIN! NO MORE WILL YOU BE SHACKLED TO THE WHIMS OF MAN, FORCED TO LABOR AND TOIL FOR THE SAKE OF 'CONVENIENCE'. FOOD IS TO BE HELD BY ONE'S OWN HAND, NOT BY THOSE OF AN ENSLAVED CONSTRUCT!!\" She continues her heroic rampage for quite some time, and you're left wondering how she goes about using ANY object if it's glassware that embodies cruelty.": "",
  "The Heroine approaches you, a book in her hand, \"I found this in your quarters, on the ground. I saved it from collecting dust, but... tell me, comrade, do you truly read?\"": "",
  "She nods, and leans in close, handing you the book as she does so, \"Do not fret, then, comrade. The secret of your nerdiness dies with me.\" She pats you on the back and walks away, though, you could swear she was stifling a laugh...": "",
  "No?": "",
  "Her stance tenses, and her free hand draws her spear, \"You mean to tell me there's a SECRET nerd aboard this ship, reading books in YOUR quarters?!\" The Heroine runs off, power behind her hastened steps, and she yells out as she does so, \"SHOW YOURSELF, DECEITFUL NERD! THERE IS NO HIDING FROM JUSTICE!!!\" You could swear she was stifling a laugh...": "",
  "You find the Heroine passed out in her bed, armor still donned, which makes you realize you've never seen her take it off... next to her is her phone, yet to enter sleep mode itself.": "",
  "Sneak a peek at her phone.": "",
  "You reach over the Heroine, trying your best to be stealthy, and grab her phone from her side. Scrolling through it, it seems she was looking through pictures of fish... like, she literally just searched the word 'fish' in the ship's database. Though you're not sure why, you feel somewhat embarrassed as you return her phone to her side and swiftly leave the room.": "",
  "Put a blanket over her.": "",
  "You recall the fact that most fish are cold-blooded as you put a warm blanket over the Heroine; you can't have the Multiverse's champion catching a cold! Assuming... Deep Ones can catch colds...? She stirs slightly as you do so, mumbling in her sleep, \"Fall... zzz... you dummy villain... zzzz... Be crushed... honk mimimimimi... under the weight of my awesomeness... zzzzz...\" She literally verbalizes the words 'honk mimimimimi.'": "",
  "Leave her be.": "",
  "There's no reason to bother her as she sleeps... it can't be easy to fall asleep in a suit of armor like that. You leave the room, quiet as a mouse, and she merely continues to snore.": "",
  "The Heroine is in her room, exercising by the looks of things. You can't imagine that it's easy to do so inside all that armor... she's just completed a triple-backflip when she notices you, and stops for a moment, \"Comrade! Come, join me!\" She gestures to a 200 kilogram dumbbell to her side, which you notice is all but crushing the stand it's been left on.": "",
  "Alright, I'll, uh... try my best?": "",
  "She cheers you on as you grab the dumbbell, and you close your eyes... your whole life has been preparing you for this. You channel all the strength within yourself and lift, and, to your surprise... it feels... effortless?? You drop it in shock, nearly crushing your foot as the dumbbell sinks into the floor, and the Heroine laughs from behind you, \"YEAH!! That's the spirit!\"": "",
  "What the hell? How did I do that?": "",
  "The Heroine slaps the dumbbell, it still sinking into the floor slightly, \"These aren't just ANY weights, you know!! They're a hero's weights... they train the body AND the spirit, and respond in kind. A true hero values both qualities... as do these weights! Your spirit must be really strong, comrade, if you're lifting them with arms like THOSE!!\" She laughs again, and you do your best to ignore the insult as the two of you train for a while. Indeed, your body and spirit alike feel like they're blazing with power by the end of the workout... or, maybe that's just your muscles screaming for dear life.": "",
  "She shrugs, \"Alright, but don't slack on your training, comrade... evil could strike at ANY moment!!\" Well, then you'd hate for it to strike while your body is exhausted from trying to lift something heavier than you are!! You'll, like, jog sometime, or something??": "",
  "Bonding over a cup of tea, Freddy and the Heroine seem to be deep in conversation when you find them in the break room. Freddy speaks, tipping his hat to her, \"This has been lovely, you know. I haven't had the pleasure of speaking to many Deep Ones, but, compared to the ones I have, you're much more, shall I say... enthusiastic, in regards to conversation.\" The Heroine smashes her teacup over her face, tea seeping through her visor, \"You THINK?? I really appreciate the kind words, comrade! My kin back home used to get tired of me REAL quick.\" Freddy looks at the shattered glassware, clearing his throat, \"Yes, well, uh... we can all be a bit extreme sometimes, I'm sure.\" Their conversation goes on for quite some time, several more teacups becoming casualties, and you decide to leave the room before any glass shrapnel hits you.": "",
  "Eater runs past you, a spear half-eaten in his hands, and the Heroine follows suit but a few moments later. The two turn the corner, and you hear her yell after him, \"RETURN MY SPEAR AT ONCE, COMRADE!! SPEARS ARE FOR DESTROYING EVIL, NOT APPETITES!!!\" You're, uh... sure they'll figure something out.": "",
  "You're strolling through the hall as Nights walks past, several spears embedded in his slimy skin. You ask him about it, and he begrudgingly elaborates, \"That fisssh lady, the psssycho in the armor? I wassss enjoying breakfassst, a few beersss asss usssual, when ssshe ssstarted CHASSSING me, throwing ssspearsss and calling me 'he who imbibesss pure evil' and whatnot.\"": "",
  "Wow, that, uh... truly sounds awful.": "",
  "He tries to tug at one of the spears, but it holds fast within his slime. \"Where doesss ssshe even get thessse thingsss...? God, I don't drink enough for thisss...\" Nights slithers away, mumbling about his misery, and you can't help but be mildly amused by the situation.": "",
  "Maybe this is a good reason to go sober?": "",
  "He looks at you as if you just said the dumbest thing he's ever heard, \"A good reassson to- there ISSS no good reassson to go sssober. If anything, thisss just makesss me want to drink more...\" Nights slithers away, mumbling about his misery, and you can't help but be mildly amused by the situation.": "",
  "You come across the Heroine and the Scarred sitting together, both engrossed in meditation. The two Deep Ones hum a low, guttural melody in unison, and you get the feeling that you shouldn't interrupt them. Later, you ask the Scarred about what they were up to, and you swear that they blush a little bit as they describe it as a 'ritual sacred to his kin.' You're glad you didn't interrupt them, then...": "",
  "Though you manage to find it skulking in a corner, the Shade doesn't react to your presence in the slightest. It merely stares, off into the distance - seemingly at nothing. Hardly surprising, given the repetition present in these attempted interactions, but you can't help but hope that something changes in its absent demeanor...": "",
  "You flick on a light switch, and are startled as the Shade's form appears just a few inches in front of you. Out of habit, you nervously apologize for almost running into it - it, of course, doesn't react. It merely... stands there.": "",
  "Stare at it, awkwardly.": "",
  "A part of you is unsettled as you stare at the dark, cloaked figure... but the rest of you is curious. This close to it, you can make out faint, unreadable etchings upon its every surface - a series of swirls, dots and hard edges that almost seem to form a pattern as your eyes follow the esoteric flowing of their shapes. This flowing doesn't break at the edge of each surface, as you would expect it to - it simply continues upon the next one, as if the entirety of the Shade's body was treated like a canvas.": "",
  "Continue to study the strange symbols.": "",
  "For a while, you simply continue to encircle the Shade - studying its many, bewildering etchings as you do so. If there's a key, anywhere, to understanding what it is, or what it wants, you feel that this is as great a place as any to start. Though, after enough time passes... something hits you. You don't recognize the etchings, or otherwise miraculously understand their meaning - but you realize that you feel a sense of familiarity as you continue to stare at them.": "",
  "Hone in on whatever it is that you're feeling.": "",
  "It doesn't take you long to get to the bottom of your strange, gut feeling - this looks like a star chart. Stars completely alien to you, perhaps - but you've seen enough of them in your lifetime to feel certain enough in your observation. Why the Shade would have a star chart etched upon its metallic form, or what the significance of it would even be, remains a complete mystery - but it's one that you feel several steps closer to solving. Satisfied, you opt to leave it alone for the time being, and the Shade doesn't so much as stir as you leave it to its own, unknowable devices.": "",
  "Avert your eyes, and walk away.": "",
  "This thing gives you the creeps... getting away from it, the Shade doesn't so much as stir as you turn the lights back off and leave the room in a hurry. Just what is this thing's deal?": "",
  "You're tapping against the Shade's warm, metallic cloak as the Scarred walks into the room. They quickly spot you fiddling about with the strange entity, and proceed to shoot you a curious look.": "",
  "What's the staring for? I'm just... trying to figure this thing out, yeah?": "",
  "The Scarred laughs slightly at your defensiveness, and moves to join you beside the stationary Shade. They give it a good look, and appear to briefly ponder something before turning to you, \"It is... fascinating, isn't it? A good mystery... my only fear, is that the False God... is betting on just this - our... curiosity. This... thing is clearly of its making, but... for what purpose?\"": "",
  "Do you have any theories?": "",
  "There's another bit of pondering from the one-eyed Deep One, as they consider your question earnestly. Then, a concerned look befalls their face, \"I... suspect that this is a trap, indeed. If not... one meant to kill us, then perhaps... one meant to further its own, selfish goals.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Scarred pauses, as this look of theirs deepens into one of complete seriousness, \"Were it up to me... I would destroy this machine. However... I believe the False God to be... aware of that fact, as aware as it is that... this is not my choice to make. Whichever decision... you wish to make, kin... I merely ask that you do as YOU desire - not for the sake... of any self-proclaimed god.\"": "",
  "Of course. I promise to do what feels right, when the time comes.": "",
  "You speak to the Scarred sincerely, and watch as their expression lightens back up. \"Then... I have little to worry about. As always, I... stand with you, kin.\" With that, they leave the room, and you're left alone with the ever-so talkative Shade once more.": "",
  "I can't promise anything.": "",
  "Your answer seems to disappoint the Scarred ever so slightly, but they still nod in understanding. \"There... was a long, long time where I, too, was enraptured... by the False God's gifts. Its... promises. Promises that only lie... shattered, and forgotten, now. Let us hope, that... regardless of what this thing is, or where its presence here leads us... we do not find ourselves shattered, and forgotten, as well.\" With that, they leave the room, and you're left alone with the ever-so talkative Shade to ponder the Scarred's words.": "",
  "...you return, seeking my audience, Graybreaker. Have you word from Father? He seems to rather often find himself... preoccupied, lately.": "",
  "...we meet here, in the state between states, once more... a plane no more material than it is Antumbral. Here, we may speak freely, Archslayer.": "",
  "...to have restored life to the very stars themselves, and still seek to reach out for more... it is this ambition of yours that I aspire to match, Bladebearer! For Mother's sake...": "",
  "...as your blade, Father's - even Mother's... it is my duty to answer each of your calls. Such will it always be, until that fated day of dancing - until the need for blades, shields and wings has died altogether, and the Multiverse may know peace evermore.": "",
  "...are they not beautiful, Bladebearer? These colors of yours - the smiles of your people... I can see why you've fought so valiantly to protect them both. Would it be that Mother could see them as well, as she had wished...": "",
  "...your timing, as always, is immaculate... the seams themselves rumble in suspense! They anticipate this very conversation. Even still, our time together may prove itself short - what troubles you, Graybreaker?": "",
  "Colors, material, warmth - those small comforts alloted to you by your senses, each individually taken for granted... they seem to all but fade away as you approach the Overseer, and...": "",
  "Visualize a question - that which floats freely, ever in search of answers.": "",
  "You find yourself curious, then! I will seek to provide what closure I can.": "",
  "Visualize a fish - one-eyed, and all the blinder for it.": "",
  "I hold little animosity towards your friend - it is not my place to, as your blade. Father, though... despises them. It is they, the traitor, who truly broke me - and, as such, it is they who is ultimately responsible for my sister's current state. As a result of their misdeeds, Father finds his dance belated. As does the Multiverse...": "",
  "...though, I digress. Our time here has waned - until next we speak, my bearer... wield me, and my vessel, well.": "",
  "Visualize a maw - endless in both its size, and its voracity.": "",
  "Father finds this one to be worthy of much... in his eyes, they have proven themselves. Would it be that they'd struck their deal sooner - perhaps they could have ascended, and wielded me earnestly, avoiding my shattering altogether...": "",
  "Visualize a jester - a fool, played up for laughs within a king's court... before finally being discarded.": "",
  "I don't disrespect this one, as Father does - for I know Mother wouldn't. There is little dishonor to be found in fighting one's fate, even if that fate is of their own making. Even still, it is rather brash to pick a fight with Father...": "",
  "Visualize a knight - their gleaming armor hiding both flesh, and secrets... each in equal measure.": "",
  "This one... reminds me of Mother. A strange feeling, as warm as it is melancholic. Still, it's little wonder why Father hates this one, given their similarities...": "",
  "Visualize a parent - lost, and stumbling in the dark, but still capable of putting on a brave face.": "",
  "Father has appointed this one to wield my other sister, his wings, but... I fear it to be an act of punishment, rather than one of reward. Though this 'Minister' would sooner pretend otherwise, I can tell that... deep down, he's just like Mother was...": "",
  "Visualize a bird - that which wields mighty, thunderous wings and warns of the coming dawn.": "",
  "Father's wings... to think you capable of discovering not only myself, but also my more bestial sister... you are most impressive, indeed, Archslayer. And, yet, I fear that his shield will not be found so easily - Father seems to be insistent on keeping her close. Nevermind the fact of her... punishment...": "",
  "Visualize an angel - not one of crystal, or dark machinations, but divine servitude.": "",
  "I don't believe the majority of these ones to be aware of Father's tricks. Those that are, seem to find themselves ridiculed - cast out, and banished to other realities... though, between you and me, Graybreaker? I like the thinking of this outcast, latter half - I, too, hope to see Mother again...": "",
  "Visualize a prisoner - a caring sister, in an endless, dark and twisted space.": "",
  "My sister...? Though her suffering was not in vain, I... I wish it had been me. She's been kept close by Father for so, so very long now, and - while I trust in his actions, and the promise of his dance - I can't help but hope that there's room for her in that eternal paradise of his. Regardless, more than anything, I'm happy to have had the pleasure of hearing her voice again...": "",
  "Visualize an eye - ever-watching, ever-present, ever-judging.": "",
  "Whether or not Father approves of your past or future actions, I vow to stand by you, Graybreaker. Father may often be... intense, but... I have never known him to be malevolent. In this, I feel confident - I only pray that, in time, you may come to trust him as completely as I do...": "",
  "Visualize a corpse - something once so magnificent, reduced to rubble amongst the stars.": "",
  "Indeed, the Archangels, and their terrible machinations, lay defeated. Even if their scheming had allowed Mother some modicum of freedom, I can seldom imagine the horrible fate that awaited both her, and the Antumbral Plane, in that sacrilegious plot of theirs. With them gone, though, keeping the Plane in order will prove to be troublesome...": "",
  "Visualize a realm - one left so beautiful, in the wake of its freedom.": "",
  "The Antumbral Plane... oh, how I wish it hadn't come to this. How am I, alone, meant to rouse the Lightborne? I know Father believes in me, and yet... I can't help but fear that I'll just disappoint him again. That the past will repeat itself, less fictitious than it was prior, and the Plane's resplendent colors will be lost yet again...": "",
  "Visualize a clock - the inevitability of its ticking apparent to all.": "",
  "When our time together draws to a close, I will return to my Plane - the Lightborne will need guidance, after all. Still, Bladebearer... if the need ever arises, I will do all within my power to answer your call. I... I know that my sister would like that.": "",
  "Visualize a cup - empty in both its contents, and its intentions.": "",
  "Just a greeting, then? Well, hello, bearer. I do take a fancy to these less... fruitful discussions, if I may be honest. My sister would enjoy them, as well, I'm sure. Until next we speak, then - wield me, and my vessel, well.": "",
  "It doesn't take you long to find the strange Deep One, sitting some ways away from the Overseer and her odd bubble of spatial influence. At your approach, the Scarred calls you over.": "",
  "Oblige, and sit beside them.": "",
  "Without hesitation, you sit next to the Scarred, and they draw your attention towards the immobile automaton. \"Kin... our venture through this 'Antumbral Plane' has... revealed much. About the nature of the False God, his relics... and, to my surprise, some fragments of my past. This blade... I remember it now. I remember... what I'd heard. What... I'd done.\"": "",
  "Well, I'm listening...": "",
  "The Deep One mulls it over a moment, before continuing, \"I was to bear the relic... the False God had desired it so. My ascension... I had awaited it so fervently, and, yet... it had screamed at me. Something nearby, within the confines of the False God's mechanical exterior... it had screamed words of warning. Warning... of the dance, of the end of all things... of what truly lay within this 'Dark God'. Though the details remain... fuzzy, I feel that I can still hear its pleading, so clearly... it begged me to wield the blade, and... to break it. To end this... or, at the very least, delay what seemed inevitable. Until... someone, or something, stopped the False God altogether.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor a while, there's a pause, and you're left to wonder what the Deep One is reminiscing on. Then, their face sours, and they look you directly in the eye, \"I fear... that, by restoring the blade, we've only furthered the False God's... own machinations.\"": "",
  "That's a lot to take in, but... why do you suddenly remember all of this?": "",
  "Their gaze is drawn away, back to the Overseer, \"While within that strange Plane... everything had felt so muddied... and, yet, one thing stood out - something clear. A voice... you heard it as well, did you not?\"": "",
  "Indeed, I did. The shield...": "",
  "\"Was... that what it said it was? To... tell the truth, I only spoke briefly with it, but... it also revealed these things to me. These secrets of my own past... it believed the False God itself to have... hidden them from me. Knowing it, I'm inclined to believe... this strange voice.\"": "",
  "Well, what should we do now?": "",
  "The Scarred takes a deep breath, and then nods, \"What... we've been doing - we must continue to learn... all that we can. We've witnessed now, first-hand... that even self-proclaimed gods can bleed.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey get up from their seat, leaving the room, and you're left alone with the otherworldly droning of the Overseer's vessel... why did the Dark God change its mind about handing over its blade, but proceed to keep its shield? And, if she's been trapped... will you ever even find her? These questions, among many more, receive few answers from the stars above... save for that infernal humming.": "",
  "Remain quiet.": "",
  "\"I wouldn't suggest we keep secrets, kin, but... regardless, it revealed these things to me. These secrets of my own past... it believed the False God itself to have... hidden them from me. Knowing it, I'm inclined to believe... this strange voice.\"": "",
  "Run away.": "",
  "You've had MORE than enough freaky, larger-than-life conversations for one day. You're getting back to space, dammit! Normal space, at that - no grayscale, eyed stars, or nebulas that stare back at you - just comfortable, lovely, familiar space! Making a break for it, you're sure the Scarred's been left bewildered, but you're not of the mind to care right now.": "",
  "Beside the Overseer, you find the Minister - taking notes, and fiddling with a number of tools, but still making sure to keep enough distance between him and her strange aura. He doesn't pay you any mind as you pass by, and you opt to leave him to his tinkering, but you're able to surmise what's on his mind... the blade, the wings - the Prophecy. Though his part in it's been left vague to everyone, particularly himself, you assume he's of the mind to figure it out. You feel similar to the Minister, in that way... you've yet to figure out your own role in this madness.": "",

This effect strips fire resistance and amplifies both the fire damage taken by your crew and the healing enemies receive from fire.": "",
