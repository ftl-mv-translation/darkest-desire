"\tAside from a brief history of Shell occupation prior to its abandonment, this sector remains entirely uncolonized by the galaxy at large. Notable, though, is that this unoccupation is not from a lack of trying. Several factions, and many more minor parties, have attempted to enter this nebulous mass; yet no reports back have ever officially been documented. Rumors point to many things: Slug pirates hunting within the clouds, secret Shell experiments gone wrong, even talk of illegal Duskbringer activity... but nobody has ever returned to say for certain. Thus has this mysterious sector earned its name: the Nebulous Dead Zone. You should stay vigilant, lest you become its next victim."
