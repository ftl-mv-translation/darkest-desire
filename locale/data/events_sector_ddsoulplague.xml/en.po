"up, and tenses it... for a moment, you're left wondering what's supposed to "
"happen, but then a resplendent, roaring flame bursts out from the very air "
"between her fingertips! She pulls her hand back, and the golden fire stays "
"hovering in the air where she left it, \"This... is 'hope'. The prison's "
"Children, or, heavens forbid, its Weavers, will undoubtedly try to bargain "
"with you once you're within their realm. They may promise power, freedom, "
"peace, WHATEVER; all of it will be lies for the sole purpose of luring you "
"to your death. THAT, is where 'hope' comes in. It is a fraction of my power,"
" and what's caused my imprisonment in the first place... it is to act as "
"your torch in the upcoming darkness. Invoke it, and you may burn away the "
"shadows of doubt, revealing truth... what that truth entails, exactly, is up"
" to you. I only ask that you use it wisely, for its power is finite.\" She "
"gestures for you to take the flame, and you hestitantly cup it in your "
"hands... but it doesn't burn you. Rather, you feel that you find it "
"soothing."
