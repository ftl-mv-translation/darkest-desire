Each one rises from the ground, makes a strike, and finds its attack cut short by a swift turning of her spear. After a while, this charade ends, and the voice's attention returns to you with that same, calm demeanor it'd had earlier, \"ONE DAY, I WILL HAVE HER HEAD. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND... ARE STRONGER THAN EVEN HER. SHE KNOWS THIS, AND SEEKS TO EXPLOIT IT. I KNOW THIS AS WELL, AS THOROUGHLY AS I KNOW ALL THINGS, AND HAVE INVITED YOU INTO MY EMBRACE ACCORDINGLY.\""
